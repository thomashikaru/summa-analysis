<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider each law by itself; and (1) The eternal law; (2) 
The natural law; (3) The human law; (4) The old law; (5) The new law, 
which is the law of the Gospel. Of the sixth law which is the law of the 
"fomes," suffice what we have said when treating of original sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the eternal law is a sovereign type [*Ratio] existing in God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the eternal law is not a sovereign type 
existing in God. For there is only one eternal law. But there are many 
types of things in the Divine mind; for Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 
46) that God "made each thing according to its type." Therefore the 
eternal law does not seem to be a type existing in the Divine mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is essential to a law that it be promulgated by word, 
as stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But Word is a Personal name in God, as 
stated in the FP, Question [34], Article [1]: whereas type refers to the Essence. 
Therefore the eternal law is not the same as a Divine type.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxx): "We see a law above 
our minds, which is called truth." But the law which is above our minds 
is the eternal law. Therefore truth is the eternal law. But the idea of 
truth is not the same as the idea of a type. Therefore the eternal law is 
not the same as the sovereign type. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "the eternal 
law is the sovereign type, to which we must always conform."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as in every artificer there pre-exists a type of the 
things that are made by his art, so too in every governor there must 
pre-exist the type of the order of those things that are to be done by 
those who are subject to his government. And just as the type of the 
things yet to be made by an art is called the art or exemplar of the 
products of that art, so too the type in him who governs the acts of his 
subjects, bears the character of a law, provided the other conditions be 
present which we have mentioned above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>). Now God, by His wisdom, is 
the Creator of all things in relation to which He stands as the artificer 
to the products of his art, as stated in the FP, Question [14], Article [8]. Moreover He 
governs all the acts and movements that are to be found in each single 
creature, as was also stated in the FP, Question [103], Article [5]. Wherefore as the 
type of the Divine Wisdom, inasmuch as by It all things are created, has 
the character of art, exemplar or idea; so the type of Divine Wisdom, as 
moving all things to their due end, bears the character of law. 
Accordingly the eternal law is nothing else than the type of Divine 
Wisdom, as directing all actions and movements.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking in that passage of the ideal types 
which regard the proper nature of each single thing; and consequently in 
them there is a certain distinction and plurality, according to their 
different relations to things, as stated in the FP, Question [15], Article [2]. But law 
is said to direct human acts by ordaining them to the common good, as 
stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And things, which are in themselves 
different, may be considered as one, according as they are ordained to 
one common thing. Wherefore the eternal law is one since it is the type 
of this order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> With regard to any sort of word, two points may be 
considered: viz. the word itself, and that which is expressed by the 
word. For the spoken word is something uttered by the mouth of man, and 
expresses that which is signified by the human word. The same applies to 
the human mental word, which is nothing else that something conceived by 
the mind, by which man expresses his thoughts mentally. So then in God 
the Word conceived by the intellect of the Father is the name of a 
Person: but all things that are in the Father's knowledge, whether they 
refer to the Essence or to the Persons, or to the works of God, are 
expressed by this Word, as Augustine declares (De Trin. xv, 14). And 
among other things expressed by this Word, the eternal law itself is 
expressed thereby. Nor does it follow that the eternal law is a Personal 
name in God: yet it is appropriated to the Son, on account of the kinship 
between type and word.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The types of the Divine intellect do not stand in the same 
relation to things, as the types of the human intellect. For the human 
intellect is measured by things, so that a human concept is not true by 
reason of itself, but by reason of its being  consonant with things, 
since "an opinion is true or false according as it answers to the 
reality." But the Divine intellect is the measure of things: since each 
thing has so far truth in it, as it represents the Divine intellect, as 
was stated in the FP, Question [16], Article [1]. Consequently the Divine intellect is 
true in itself; and its type is truth itself.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the eternal law is known to all?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the eternal law is not known to all. Because, 
as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++2:11">1 Cor. 2:11</a>), "the things that are of God no man 
knoweth, but the Spirit of God." But the eternal law is a type existing 
in the Divine mind. Therefore it is unknown to all save God alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) "the eternal law 
is that by which it is right that all things should be most orderly." But 
all do not know how all things are most orderly. Therefore all do not 
know the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi) that "the eternal 
law is not subject to the judgment of man." But according to Ethic. i, 
"any man can judge well of what he knows." Therefore the eternal law is 
not known to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "knowledge of 
the eternal law is imprinted on us."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may be known in two ways: first, in itself; 
secondly, in its effect, wherein some likeness of that thing is found: 
thus someone not seeing the sun in its substance, may know it by its 
rays. So then no one can know the eternal law, as it is in itself, except 
the blessed who see God in His Essence. But every rational creature knows 
it in its reflection, greater or less. For every knowledge of truth is a 
kind of reflection and participation of the eternal law, which is the 
unchangeable truth, as Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi). Now all men 
know the truth to a certain extent, at least as to the common principles 
of the natural law: and as to the others, they partake of the knowledge 
of truth, some more, some less; and in this respect are more or less 
cognizant of the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We cannot know the things that are of God, as they are in 
themselves; but they are made known to us in their effects, according to 
Rm. 1:20: "The invisible things of God . . . are clearly seen, being 
understood by the things that are made."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although each one knows the eternal law according to his 
own capacity, in the way explained above, yet none can comprehend it: for 
it cannot be made perfectly known by its effects. Therefore it does not 
follow that anyone who knows the eternal law in the way aforesaid, knows 
also the whole order of things, whereby they are most orderly. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To judge a thing may be understood in two ways. First, as 
when a cognitive power judges of its proper object, according to Job 
12:11: "Doth not the ear discern words, and the palate of him that 
eateth, the taste?" It is to this kind of judgment that the Philosopher 
alludes when he says that "anyone can judge well of what he knows," by 
judging, namely, whether what is put forward is true. In another way we 
speak of a superior judging of a subordinate by a kind of practical 
judgment, as to whether he should be such and such or not. And thus none 
can judge of the eternal law.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not every law is derived from the eternal law. 
For there is a law of the "fomes," as stated above (<A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1">Question [91]</a>, <A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), which 
is not derived from that Divine law which is the eternal law, since 
thereunto pertains the "prudence of the flesh," of which the Apostle says 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:7">Rm. 8:7</a>), that "it cannot be subject to the law of God." Therefore not 
every law is derived from the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing unjust can be derived from the eternal law, 
because, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, Objection [2]), "the eternal law is that, 
according to which it is right that all things should be most orderly." 
But some laws are unjust, according to Is. 10:1: "Woe to them that make 
wicked laws." Therefore not every law is derived from the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 5) that "the law which 
is framed for ruling the people, rightly permits many things which are 
punished by Divine providence." But the type of Divine providence is the 
eternal law, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore not even every good law is 
derived from the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Divine Wisdom says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++8:15">Prov. 8:15</a>): "By Me kings reign, 
and lawgivers decree just things." But the type of Divine Wisdom is the 
eternal law, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore all laws proceed from the 
eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), the law denotes a kind 
of plan directing acts towards an end. Now wherever there are movers 
ordained to one another, the power of the second mover must needs be 
derived from the power of the first mover; since the second mover does 
not move except in so far as it is moved by the first. Wherefore we 
observe the same in all those who govern, so that the plan of government 
is derived by secondary governors from the governor in chief; thus the 
plan of what is to be done in a state flows from the king's command to 
his inferior administrators: and again in things of art the plan of 
whatever is to be done by art flows from the chief craftsman to the 
under-crafts-men, who work with their hands. Since then the eternal law 
is the plan of government in the Chief Governor, all the plans of 
government in  the inferior governors must be derived from the eternal 
law. But these plans of inferior governors are all other laws besides the 
eternal law. Therefore all laws, in so far as they partake of right 
reason, are derived from the eternal law. Hence Augustine says (De Lib. 
Arb. i, 6) that "in temporal law there is nothing just and lawful, but 
what man has drawn from the eternal law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The "fomes" has the nature of law in man, in so far as it 
is a punishment resulting from Divine justice; and in this respect it is 
evident that it is derived from the eternal law. But in so far as it 
denotes a proneness to sin, it is contrary to the Divine law, and has not 
the nature of law, as stated above (<A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91OUTP1">Question [91]</a>, <A Href="FS091.html#FSQ91A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Human law has the nature of law in so far as it partakes of 
right reason; and it is clear that, in this respect, it is derived from 
the eternal law. But in so far as it deviates from reason, it is called 
an unjust law, and has the nature, not of law but of violence. 
Nevertheless even an unjust law, in so far as it retains some appearance 
of law, though being framed by one who is in power, is derived from the 
eternal law; since all power is from the Lord God, according to Rm. 13:1.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Human law is said to permit certain things, not as 
approving them, but as being unable to direct them. And many things are 
directed by the Divine law, which human law is unable to direct, because 
more things are subject to a higher than to a lower cause. Hence the very 
fact that human law does not meddle with matters it cannot direct, comes 
under the ordination of the eternal law. It would be different, were 
human law to sanction what the eternal law condemns. Consequently it does 
not follow that human law is not derived from the eternal law, but that 
it is not on a perfect equality with it.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that necessary and eternal things are subject to 
the eternal law. For whatever is reasonable is subject to reason. But the 
Divine will is reasonable, for it is just. Therefore it is subject to 
(the Divine) reason. But the eternal law is the Divine reason. Therefore 
God's will is subject to the eternal law. But God's will is eternal. 
Therefore eternal and necessary things are subject to the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is subject to the King, is subject to the 
King's law. Now the Son, according to 1 Cor. 15:28,24, "shall be subject 
. . . to God and the Father . . . when He shall have delivered up the 
Kingdom to Him." Therefore the Son, Who is eternal, is subject to the 
eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the eternal law is Divine providence as a type. But many 
necessary things are subject to Divine providence:  for instance, the 
stability of incorporeal substances and of the heavenly bodies. Therefore 
even necessary things are subject to the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things that are necessary cannot be otherwise, and 
consequently need no restraining. But laws are imposed on men, in order 
to restrain them from evil, as explained above (<A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92OUTP1">Question [92]</a>, <A Href="FS092.html#FSQ92A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore 
necessary things are not subject to the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the eternal law is the type of 
the Divine government. Consequently whatever is subject to the Divine 
government, is subject to the eternal law: while if anything is not 
subject to the Divine government, neither is it subject to the eternal 
law. The application of this distinction may be gathered by looking 
around us. For those things are subject to human government, which can be 
done by man; but what pertains to the nature of man is not subject to 
human government; for instance, that he should have a soul, hands, or 
feet. Accordingly all that is in things created by God, whether it be 
contingent or necessary, is subject to the eternal law: while things 
pertaining to the Divine Nature or Essence are not subject to the eternal 
law, but are the eternal law itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We may speak of God's will in two ways. First, as to the 
will itself: and thus, since God's will is His very Essence, it is 
subject neither to the Divine government, nor to the eternal law, but is 
the same thing as the eternal law. Secondly, we may speak of God's will, 
as to the things themselves that God wills about creatures; which things 
are subject to the eternal law, in so far as they are planned by Divine 
Wisdom. In reference to these things God's will is said to be reasonable 
[rationalis]: though regarded in itself it should rather be called their 
type [ratio].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God the Son was not made by God, but was naturally born of 
God. Consequently He is not subject to Divine providence or to the 
eternal law: but rather is Himself the eternal law by a kind of 
appropriation, as Augustine explains (De Vera Relig. xxxi). But He is 
said to be subject to the Father by reason of His human nature, in 
respect of which also the Father is said to be greater than He.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The third objection we grant, because it deals with those necessary 
things that are created.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Metaph. v, text. 6), some 
necessary things have a cause of their necessity: and thus they derive 
from something else the fact that they cannot be otherwise. And this is 
in itself a most effective restraint; for whatever is restrained, is said 
to be restrained in so far as it cannot do otherwise than it is allowed 
to.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that natural contingents are not subject to the 
eternal law. Because promulgation is essential to law, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90OUTP1">Question [90]</a>, <A Href="FS090.html#FSQ90A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But a law cannot be promulgated except to rational 
creatures, to whom it is possible to make an announcement. Therefore none 
but rational creatures are subject to the eternal law; and consequently 
natural contingents are not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Whatever obeys reason partakes somewhat of reason," as 
stated in Ethic. i. But the eternal law, is the supreme type, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Since then natural contingents do not partake of reason in 
any way, but are altogether void of reason, it seems that they are not 
subject to the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the eternal law is most efficient. But in natural 
contingents defects occur. Therefore they are not subject to the eternal 
law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++8:29">Prov. 8:29</a>): "When He compassed the sea 
with its bounds, and set a law to the waters, that they should not pass 
their limits."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We must speak otherwise of the law of man, than of the 
eternal law which is the law of God. For the law of man extends only to 
rational creatures subject to man. The reason of this is because law 
directs the actions of those that are subject to the government of 
someone: wherefore, properly speaking, none imposes a law on his own 
actions. Now whatever is done regarding the use of irrational things 
subject to man, is done by the act of man himself moving those things, 
for these irrational creatures do not move themselves, but are moved by 
others, as stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Consequently man cannot impose laws 
on irrational beings, however much they may be subject to him. But he can 
impose laws on rational beings subject to him, in so far as by his 
command or pronouncement of any kind, he imprints on their minds a rule 
which is a principle of action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now just as man, by such pronouncement, impresses a kind of inward 
principle of action on the man that is subject to him, so God imprints on 
the whole of nature the principles of its proper actions. And so, in this 
way, God is said to command the whole of nature, according to Ps. 148:6: 
"He hath made a decree, and it shall not pass away." And thus all actions 
and movements of the whole of nature are subject to the eternal law. 
Consequently irrational creatures are subject to the eternal law, through 
being moved by Divine providence; but not, as rational creatures are, 
through understanding the Divine commandment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The impression of an inward active principle is to natural 
things, what the promulgation of law is to men: because law, by being 
promulgated, imprints on man a directive principle of human actions, as 
stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Irrational creatures neither partake of nor are  obedient 
to human reason: whereas they do partake of the Divine Reason by obeying 
it; because the power of Divine Reason extends over more things than 
human reason does. And as the members of the human body are moved at the 
command of reason, and yet do not partake of reason, since they have no 
apprehension subordinate to reason; so too irrational creatures are moved 
by God, without, on that account, being rational.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the defects which occur in natural things are 
outside the order of particular causes, they are not outside the order of 
universal causes, especially of the First Cause, i.e. God, from Whose 
providence nothing can escape, as stated in the FP, Question [22], Article [2]. And 
since the eternal law is the type of Divine providence, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), hence the defects of natural things are subject to the eternal 
law.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all human affairs are subject to the eternal law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all human affairs are subject to the 
eternal law. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++5:18">Gal. 5:18</a>): "If you are led by the 
spirit you are not under the law." But the righteous who are the sons of 
God by adoption, are led by the spirit of God, according to Rm. 8:14: 
"Whosoever are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God." 
Therefore not all men are under the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:7">Rm. 8:7</a>): "The prudence [Vulg.: 
'wisdom'] of the flesh is an enemy to God: for it is not subject to the 
law of God." But many are those in whom the prudence of the flesh 
dominates. Therefore all men are not subject to the eternal law which is 
the law of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. i, 6) that "the eternal law 
is that by which the wicked deserve misery, the good, a life of 
blessedness." But those who are already blessed, and those who are 
already lost, are not in the state of merit. Therefore they are not under 
the eternal law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 12): "Nothing evades 
the laws of the most high Creator and Governor, for by Him the peace of 
the universe is administered."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two ways in which a thing is subject to the 
eternal law, as explained above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>): first, by partaking of the 
eternal law by way of knowledge; secondly, by way of action and passion, 
i.e. by partaking of the eternal law by way of an inward motive 
principle: and in this second way, irrational creatures are subject to 
the eternal law, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). But since the rational nature, 
together with that which it has in common with all creatures, has 
something proper to itself inasmuch as it is rational, consequently it is 
subject to the eternal law in both ways; because while each rational 
creature has some knowledge of the eternal law, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), 
it also has a natural  inclination to that which is in harmony with the 
eternal law; for "we are naturally adapted to the recipients of virtue" 
(Ethic. ii, 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Both ways, however, are imperfect, and to a certain extent destroyed, in 
the wicked; because in them the natural inclination to virtue is 
corrupted by vicious habits, and, moreover, the natural knowledge of good 
is darkened by passions and habits of sin. But in the good both ways are 
found more perfect: because in them, besides the natural knowledge of 
good, there is the added knowledge of faith and wisdom; and again, 
besides the natural inclination to good, there is the added motive of 
grace and virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the good are perfectly subject to the eternal law, as 
always acting according to it: whereas the wicked are subject to the 
eternal law, imperfectly as to their actions, indeed, since both their 
knowledge of good, and their inclination thereto, are imperfect; but this 
imperfection on the part of action is supplied on the part of passion, in 
so far as they suffer what the eternal law decrees concerning them, 
according as they fail to act in harmony with that law. Hence Augustine 
says (De Lib. Arb. i, 15): "I esteem that the righteous act according to 
the eternal law; and (De Catech. Rud. xviii): Out of the just misery of 
the souls which deserted Him, God knew how to furnish the inferior parts 
of His creation with most suitable laws."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of the Apostle may be understood in two ways. 
First, so that a man is said to be under the law, through being pinned 
down thereby, against his will, as by a load. Hence, on the same passage 
a gloss says that "he is under the law, who refrains from evil deeds, 
through fear of punishment threatened by the law, and not from love of 
virtue." In this way the spiritual man is not under the law, because he 
fulfils the law willingly, through charity which is poured into his heart 
by the Holy Ghost. Secondly, it can be understood as meaning that the 
works of a man, who is led by the Holy Ghost, are the works of the Holy 
Ghost rather than his own. Therefore, since the Holy Ghost is not under 
the law, as neither is the Son, as stated above (<A Href="FS093.html#FSQ93A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2); it follows 
that such works, in so far as they are of the Holy Ghost, are not under 
the law. The Apostle witnesses to this when he says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++3:17">2 Cor. 3:17</a>): "Where 
the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The prudence of the flesh cannot be subject to the law of 
God as regards action; since it inclines to actions contrary to the 
Divine law: yet it is subject to the law of God, as regards passion; 
since it deserves to suffer punishment according to the law of Divine 
justice. Nevertheless in no man does the prudence of the flesh dominate 
so far as to destroy the whole good of his nature: and consequently there 
remains in man the inclination to act in accordance with the eternal law. 
For we have seen above (<A Href="FS085.html#FSQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="FS085.html#FSQ85A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that sin does not destroy entirely 
the good of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[93] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A thing is maintained in the end and moved  towards the end 
by one and the same cause: thus gravity which makes a heavy body rest in 
the lower place is also the cause of its being moved thither. We 
therefore reply that as it is according to the eternal law that some 
deserve happiness, others unhappiness, so is it by the eternal law that 
some are maintained in a happy state, others in an unhappy state. 
Accordingly both the blessed and the damned are under the eternal law.<br>
