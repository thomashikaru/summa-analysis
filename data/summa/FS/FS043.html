<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the cause of fear: under which head there are two 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ43A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether love is the cause of fear?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ43A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether defect is the cause of fear?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that love is not the cause of fear. For that which 
leads to a thing is its cause. But "fear leads to the love of charity" as 
Augustine says on the canonical epistle of John (Tract. ix). Therefore 
fear is the cause of love, and not conversely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 5) that "those are 
feared most from whom we dread the advent of some evil." But the dread of 
evil being caused by someone, makes us hate rather than love him. 
Therefore fear is caused by hate rather than by love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it has been stated above (<A Href="FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="FS042.html#FSQ42A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that those  
things which occur by our own doing are not fearful. But that which we do 
from love, is done from our inmost heart. Therefore fear is not caused by 
love.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Questions. 83, qu. 33): "There can be no doubt 
that there is no cause for fear save the loss of what we love, when we 
possess it, or the failure to obtain what we hope for." Therefore all 
fear is caused by our loving something: and consequently love is the 
cause of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The objects of the soul's passions stand in relation 
thereto as the forms to things natural or artificial: because the 
passions of the soul take their species from their objects, as the 
aforesaid things do from their forms. Therefore, just as whatever is a 
cause of the form, is a cause of the thing constituted by that form, so 
whatever is a cause, in any way whatever, of the object, is a cause of 
the passion. Now a thing may be a cause of the object, either by way of 
efficient cause, or by way of material disposition. Thus the object of 
pleasure is good apprehended as suitable and conjoined: and its efficient 
cause is that which causes the conjunction, or the suitableness, or 
goodness, or apprehension of that good thing; while its cause by way of 
material disposition, is a habit or any sort of disposition by reason of 
which this conjoined good becomes suitable or is apprehended as such.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, as to the matter in question, the object of fear is 
something reckoned as an evil to come, near at hand and difficult to 
avoid. Therefore that which can inflict such an evil, is the efficient 
cause of the object of fear, and, consequently, of fear itself. While 
that which renders a man so disposed that thing is such an evil to him, 
is a cause of fear and of its object, by way of material disposition. And 
thus it is that love causes fear: since it is through his loving a 
certain good, that whatever deprives a man of that good is an evil to 
him, and that consequently he fears it as an evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="FS042.html#FSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), fear, of itself and in the 
first place, regards the evil from which it recoils as being contrary to 
some loved good: and thus fear, of itself, is born of love. But, in the 
second place, it regards the cause from which that evil ensues: so that 
sometimes, accidentally, fear gives rise to love; in so far as, for 
instance, through fear of God's punishments, man keeps His commandments, 
and thus begins to hope, while hope leads to love, as stated above (<A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="FS040.html#FSQ40A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He, from whom evil is expected, is indeed hated at first; 
but afterwards, when once we begin to hope for good from him, we begin to 
love him. But the good, the contrary evil of which is feared, was loved 
from the beginning.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument is true of that which is the efficient cause 
of the evil to be feared: whereas love causes fear by way of material 
disposition, as stated above.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether defect is the cause of fear?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that defect is not a cause of fear. Because those 
who are in power are very much feared. But defect is contrary to power. 
Therefore defect is not a cause of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the defect of those who are already being executed is 
extreme. But such like do not fear as stated in Rhet. ii, 5. Therefore 
defect is not a cause of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contests arise from strength not from defect. But "those 
who contend fear those who contend with them" (Rhet. ii, 5). Therefore 
defect is not a cause of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Contraries ensue from contrary causes. But "wealth, 
strength, a multitude of friends, and power drive fear away" (Rhet. ii, 
5). Therefore fear is caused by lack of these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS043.html#FSQ43A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), fear may be set down to a twofold 
cause: one is by way of a material disposition, on the part of him that 
fears; the other is by way of efficient cause, on the part of the person 
feared. As to the first then, some defect is, of itself, the cause of 
fear: for it is owing to some lack of power that one is unable easily to 
repulse a threatening evil. And yet, in order to cause fear, this defect 
must be according to a measure. For the defect which causes fear of a 
future evil, is less than the defect caused by evil present, which is the 
object of sorrow. And still greater would be the defect, if perception of 
the evil, or love of the good whose contrary is feared, were entirely 
absent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as to the second, power and strength are, of themselves, the cause 
of fear: because it is owing to the fact that the cause apprehended as 
harmful is powerful, that its effect cannot be repulsed. It may happen, 
however, in this respect, that some defect causes fear accidentally, in 
so far as owing to some defect someone wishes to hurt another; for 
instance, by reason of injustice, either because that other has already 
done him a harm, or because he fears to be harmed by him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is true of the cause of fear, on the part of 
the efficient cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those who are already being executed, are actually 
suffering from a present evil; wherefore their defect exceeds the measure 
of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[43] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who contend with one another are afraid, not on 
account of the power which enables them to contend: but on account of the 
lack of power, owing to which they are not confident of victory.<br>
