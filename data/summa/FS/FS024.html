</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider good and evil in the passions of the soul: and 
under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ24A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether moral good and evil can be found in the passions of the soul?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ24A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether every passion of the soul is morally evil?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ24A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether every passion increases or decreases the goodness of malice 
of an act?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FSQ24A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether any passion is good or evil specifically?

<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no passion of the soul is morally good or 
evil. For moral good and evil are proper to man: since "morals are 
properly predicated of man," as Ambrose says (Super Luc. Prolog.). But 
passions are not proper to man, for he has them in common with other 
animals. Therefore no passion of the soul is morally good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the good or evil of man consists in "being in accord, or 
in disaccord with reason," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Now the 
passions of the soul are not in the reason, but in the sensitive 
appetite, as stated above (<A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22OUTP1">Question [22]</a>, <A Href="FS022.html#FSQ22A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore they have no 
connection with human, i.e. moral, good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 5) that "we are neither 
praised nor blamed for our passions." But we are praised and blamed for 
moral good and evil. Therefore the passions are not morally good or evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7) while speaking of 
the passions of the soul: "They are evil if our love is evil; good if our 
love is good."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may consider the passions of the soul in two ways: 
first, in themselves; secondly, as being subject to the command of the 
reason and will. If then the passions be considered in themselves, to 
wit, as movements of the irrational appetite, thus there is no moral good 
or evil in them, since this depends on the reason, as stated above (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). If, however, they be considered as subject to the command of the 
reason and will, then moral good and evil are in them. Because the 
sensitive appetite is nearer than the outward members to the reason and 
will; and yet the movements and actions of the outward members are 
morally good or evil, inasmuch as they are voluntary. Much more, 
therefore, may the passions, in so far as they are voluntary, be called 
morally good or evil. And they are said to be voluntary, either from 
being commanded by the will, or from not being checked by the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> These passions, considered in themselves, are common to man 
and other animals: but, as commanded by the reason, they are proper to 
man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even the lower appetitive powers are called rational, in so 
far as "they partake of reason in some sort" (Ethic. i, 13).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher says that we are neither praised nor blamed 
for our passions considered absolutely; but he does not exclude their 
becoming worthy of praise or blame, in so far as they are subordinate to 
reason. Hence he continues: "For the man who fears or is angry, is not 
praised . . . or blamed, but the man who is angry in a certain way, i.e. 
according to, or against reason."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether every passion of the soul is evil morally?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the passions of the soul are morally evil. 
For Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 4) that "some call the soul's 
passions diseases or disturbances of the soul" [*Those things which the 
Greeks call {pathe}, we prefer to call disturbances rather than diseases 
(Tusc. iv. 5)]. But every disease or disturbance of the soul is morally 
evil. Therefore every passion of the soul is evil morally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii, 22) that "movement in 
accord with nature is an action, but movement contrary to nature is 
passion." But in movements of the soul, what is against nature is sinful 
and morally evil: hence he says elsewhere (De Fide Orth. ii, 4) that "the 
devil turned from that which is in accord with nature to that which is 
against nature." Therefore these passions are morally evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever leads to sin, has an aspect of evil. But these 
passions lead to sin: wherefore they are called "the passions of sins" 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++7:5">Rm. 7:5</a>). Therefore it seems that they are morally evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiv, 9) that "all these 
emotions are right in those whose love is rightly placed . . . For they 
fear to sin, they desire to persevere; they grieve for sin, they rejoice 
in good works."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> On this question the opinion of the Stoics differed from 
that of the Peripatetics: for the Stoics held that all passions are evil, 
while the Peripatetics maintained that moderate passions are good. This 
difference, although it appears great in words, is nevertheless, in 
reality, none at all, or but little, if we consider the intent of either 
school. For the Stoics did not discern between sense and intellect; and 
consequently neither between the intellectual and sensitive appetite. 
Hence they did not discriminate the passions of the soul from the 
movements of the will, in so far as the passions of the soul are in the 
sensitive appetite, while the simple movements of the will are in the 
intellectual appetite: but every rational movement of the appetitive part 
they call will, while they called passion, a movement that exceeds the 
limits of reason. Wherefore Cicero, following their opinion (De Tusc. 
Quaest. iii, 4) calls all passions "diseases of the soul": whence he 
argues that "those who are diseased are unsound; and those who are 
unsound are wanting in sense." Hence we speak of those who are wanting in 
sense of being "unsound."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the Peripatetics give the name of "passions" to all 
the movements of the sensitive appetite. Wherefore they esteem them good, 
when they are controlled by reason; and evil when they are not controlled 
by reason. Hence it is evident that Cicero was wrong in disapproving (De 
Tusc. Quaest. iii, 4) of the Peripatetic theory of a mean in the 
passions, when he says that "every evil, though moderate, should be 
shunned; for, just as a body, though it be moderately ailing, is not 
sound; so, this mean in the diseases or passions of the soul, is not 
sound." For passions are not called "diseases" or "disturbances" of the 
soul, save when they are not controlled by reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence the reply to the First Objection is evident.
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In every passion there is an increase or decrease in the 
natural movement of the heart, according as the heart is moved more or 
less intensely by contraction and dilatation; and hence it derives the 
character of passion. But there is no need for passion to deviate always 
from the order of natural reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The passions of the soul, in so far as they are contrary to 
the order of reason, incline us to sin: but in so far as they are 
controlled by reason, they pertain to virtue.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether passion increases or decreases the goodness or malice of an act?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every passion decreases the goodness  of a 
moral action. For anything that hinders the judgment of reason, on which 
depends the goodness of a moral act, consequently decreases the goodness 
of the moral act. But every passion hinders the judgment of reason: for 
Sallust says (Catilin.): "All those that take counsel about matters of 
doubt, should be free from hatred, anger, friendship and pity." Therefore 
passion decreases the goodness of a moral act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the more a man's action is like to God, the better it 
is: hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:1">Eph. 5:1</a>): "Be ye followers of God, as most 
dear children." But "God and the holy angels feel no anger when they 
punish . . . no fellow-feeling with misery when they relieve the 
unhappy," as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5). Therefore it is better 
to do such like deeds without than with a passion of the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as moral evil depends on its relation to reason, so 
also does moral good. But moral evil is lessened by passion: for he sins 
less, who sins from passion, than he who sins deliberately. Therefore he 
does a better deed, who does well without passion, than he who does with 
passion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "the passion of 
pity is obedient to reason, when pity is bestowed without violating 
right, as when the poor are relieved, or the penitent forgiven." But 
nothing that is obedient to reason lessens the moral good. Therefore a 
passion of the soul does not lessen moral good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Stoics held that every passion of the soul is 
evil, they consequently held that every passion of the soul lessens the 
goodness of an act; since the admixture of evil either destroys good 
altogether, or makes it to be less good. And this is true indeed, if by 
passions we understand none but the inordinate movements of the sensitive 
appetite, considered as disturbances or ailments. But if we give the name 
of passions to all the movements of the sensitive appetite, then it 
belongs to the perfection of man's good that his passions be moderated by 
reason. For since man's good is founded on reason as its root, that good 
will be all the more perfect, according as it extends to more things 
pertaining to man. Wherefore no one questions the fact that it belongs to 
the perfection of moral good, that the actions of the outward members be 
controlled by the law of reason. Hence, since the sensitive appetite can 
obey reason, as stated above (<A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="FS017.html#FSQ17A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), it belongs to the perfection 
of moral or human good, that the passions themselves also should be 
controlled by reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly just as it is better that man should both will good and do 
it in his external act; so also does it belong to the perfection of moral 
good, that man should be moved unto good, not only in respect of his 
will, but also in respect of his sensitive appetite; according to Ps. 
83:3: "My heart and my flesh have rejoiced in the living God": where by 
"heart" we are to understand the intellectual appetite, and by "flesh" 
the sensitive appetite. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passions of the soul may stand in a twofold relation to 
the judgment of reason. First, antecedently: and thus, since they obscure 
the judgment of reason, on which the goodness of the moral act depends, 
they diminish the goodness of the act; for it is more praiseworthy to do 
a work of charity from the judgment of reason than from the mere passion 
of pity. In the second place, consequently: and this in two ways. First, 
by way of redundance: because, to wit, when the higher part of the soul 
is intensely moved to anything, the lower part also follows that 
movement: and thus the passion that results in consequence, in the 
sensitive appetite, is a sign of the intensity of the will, and so 
indicates greater moral goodness. Secondly, by way of choice; when, to 
wit, a man, by the judgment of his reason, chooses to be affected by a 
passion in order to work more promptly with the co-operation of the 
sensitive appetite. And thus a passion of the soul increases the goodness 
of an action.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In God and the angels there is no sensitive appetite, nor 
again bodily members: and so in them good does not depend on the right 
ordering of passions or of bodily actions, as it does in us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A passion that tends to evil, and precedes the judgment of 
reason, diminishes sin; but if it be consequent in either of the ways 
mentioned above (Reply OBJ 1), it aggravates the sin, or else it is a 
sign of its being more grievous.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any passion is good or evil in its species?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no passion of the soul is good or evil morally 
according to its species. Because moral good and evil depend on reason. 
But the passions are in the sensitive appetite; so that accordance with 
reason is accidental to them. Since, therefore, nothing accidental 
belongs to a thing's species, it seems that no passion is good or evil 
according to its species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, acts and passions take their species from their object. 
If, therefore, any passion were good or evil, according to its species, 
it would follow that those passions the object of which is good, are 
specifically good, such as love, desire and joy: and that those passions, 
the object of which is evil, are specifically evil, as hatred, fear and 
sadness. But this is clearly false. Therefore no passion is good or evil 
according to its species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there is no species of passion that is not to be found 
in other animals. But moral good is in man alone. Therefore no passion of 
the soul is good or evil according to its species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei ix, 5) that "pity is a kind 
of virtue." Moreover, the Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7)  that modesty 
is a praiseworthy passion. Therefore some passions are good or evil 
according to their species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We ought, seemingly, to apply to passions what has been 
said in regard to acts (<A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6; <A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="FS020.html#FSQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>)---viz. that the 
species of a passion, as the species of an act, can be considered from 
two points of view. First, according to its natural genus; and thus moral 
good and evil have no connection with the species of an act or passion. 
Secondly, according to its moral genus, inasmuch as it is voluntary and 
controlled by reason. In this way moral good and evil can belong to the 
species of a passion, in so far as the object to which a passion tends, 
is, of itself, in harmony or in discord with reason: as is clear in the 
case of "shame" which is base fear; and of "envy" which is sorrow for 
another's good: for thus passions belong to the same species as the 
external act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument considers the passions in their natural 
species, in so far as the sensitive appetite is considered in itself. But 
in so far as the sensitive appetite obeys reason, good and evil of reason 
are no longer accidentally in the passions of the appetite, but 
essentially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Passions having a tendency to good, are themselves good, if 
they tend to that which is truly good, and in like manner, if they turn 
away from that which is truly evil. On the other hand, those passions 
which consist in aversion from good, and a tendency to evil, are 
themselves evil.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[24] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In irrational animals the sensitive appetite does not obey 
reason. Nevertheless, in so far as they are led by a kind of estimative 
power, which is subject to a higher, i.e. the Divine reason, there is a 
certain likeness of moral good in them, in regard to the soul's passions.<br>
