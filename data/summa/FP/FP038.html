</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "Gift" is not a personal name. For every 
personal name imports a distinction in God. But the name of "Gift" does 
not import a distinction in God; for Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 19): 
that "the Holy Ghost is so given as God's Gift, that He also gives 
Himself as God." Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no personal name belongs to the divine essence. But the 
divine essence is the Gift which the Father gives to the Son, as Hilary 
says (De Trin. ix). Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. iv, 19) there is 
no subjection nor service in the divine persons. But gift implies a 
subjection both as regards him to whom it is given, and as regards him by 
whom it is given. Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "Gift" imports relation to the creature, and it thus 
seems to be said of God in time. But personal names are said of God from 
eternity; as "Father," and "Son." Therefore "Gift" is not a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 19): "As the body of flesh 
is nothing but flesh; so the gift of the Holy Ghost is nothing but the 
Holy Ghost." But the Holy Ghost is a personal name; so also therefore is 
"Gift."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The word "gift" imports an aptitude for being given. And 
what is given has an aptitude or relation both to the giver and to that 
to which it is given. For it would not be given by anyone, unless it was 
his to give; and it is given to someone to be his. Now a divine person is 
said to belong to another, either by origin, as the Son belongs to the 
Father; or as possessed by another. But we are said to possess what we 
can freely use or enjoy as we please: and in this way a divine person 
cannot be possessed, except by a rational creature united to God. Other 
creatures can be moved by a divine person, not, however, in such a way as 
to be able to enjoy the divine person, and to use the effect thereof. The 
rational creature does sometimes attain thereto; as when it is made 
partaker of the divine Word and of the Love proceeding, so as freely to 
know God truly and to love God rightly. Hence the rational creature alone 
can possess the divine person. Nevertheless in order that it may possess 
Him in this manner, its own power avails nothing: hence this must be 
given it from above; for that is said to be given to us which we have 
from another source. Thus a divine person can "be given," and can be a 
"gift."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The name "Gift" imports a personal distinction , in so far 
as gift imports something belonging to another through its origin. 
Nevertheless, the Holy Ghost gives Himself, inasmuch as  He is His own, 
and can use or rather enjoy Himself; as also a free man belongs to 
himself. And as Augustine says (In Joan. Tract. xxix): "What is more 
yours than yourself?" Or we might say, and more fittingly, that a gift 
must belong in a way to the giver. But the phrase, "this is this one's," 
can be understood in several senses. In one way it means identity, as 
Augustine says (In Joan. Tract. xxix); and in that sense "gift" is the 
same as "the giver," but not the same as the one to whom it is given. The 
Holy Ghost gives Himself in that sense. In another sense, a thing is 
another's as a possession, or as a slave; and in that sense gift is 
essentially distinct from the giver; and the gift of God so taken is a 
created thing. In a third sense "this is this one's" through its origin 
only; and in this sense the Son is the Father's; and the Holy Ghost 
belongs to both. Therefore, so far as gift in this way signifies the 
possession of the giver, it is personally distinguished from the giver, 
and is a personal name.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The divine essence is the Father's gift in the first sense, 
as being the Father's by way of identity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Gift as a personal name in God does not imply subjection, 
but only origin, as regards the giver; but as regards the one to whom it 
is given, it implies a free use, or enjoyment, as above explained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Gift is not so called from being actually given, but from 
its aptitude to be given. Hence the divine person is called Gift from 
eternity, although He is given in time. Nor does it follow that it is an 
essential name because it imports relation to the creature; but that it 
includes something essential in its meaning; as the essence is included 
in the idea of person, as stated above (<A Href="FP034.html#FPQ34OUTP1">Question [34]</a>, <A Href="FP034.html#FPQ34A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether "Gift" is the proper name of the Holy Ghost?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Gift is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost. 
For the name Gift comes from being given. But, as Is. 9:16 says: "A Son 
is give to us." Therefore to be Gift belongs to the Son, as well as to 
the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every proper name of a person signifies a property. But 
this word Gift does not signify a property of the Holy Ghost. Therefore 
Gift is not a proper name of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Holy Ghost can be called the spirit of a man, 
whereas He cannot be called the gift of any man, but "God's Gift" only. 
Therefore Gift is not the proper name of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. iv, 20): "As 'to be born' is, 
for the Son, to be from the Father, so, for the Holy Ghost, 'to be the 
Gift of God' is to proceed from Father and Son." But the Holy Ghost 
receives His proper name from the fact that He  proceeds from Father and 
Son. Therefore Gift is the proper name of the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Gift, taken personally in God, is the proper name of the 
Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In proof of this we must know that a gift is properly an unreturnable 
giving, as Aristotle says (Topic. iv, 4)---i.e. a thing which is not 
given with the intention of a return---and it thus contains the idea of a 
gratuitous donation. Now, the reason of donation being gratuitous is 
love; since therefore do we give something to anyone gratuitously 
forasmuch as we wish him well. So what we first give him is the love 
whereby we wish him well. Hence it is manifest that love has the nature 
of a first gift, through which all free gifts are given. So since the 
Holy Ghost proceeds as love, as stated above (<A Href="FP027.html#FPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="FP027.html#FPQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="FP037.html#FPQ37OUTP1">Question [37]</a>, <A Href="FP037.html#FPQ37A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), 
He proceeds as the first gift. Hence Augustine says (De Trin. xv, 24): 
"By the gift, which is the Holy Ghost, many particular gifts are 
portioned out to the members of Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As the Son is properly called the Image because He proceeds 
by way of a word, whose nature it is to be the similitude of its 
principle, although the Holy Ghost also is like to the Father; so also, 
because the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father as love, He is properly 
called Gift, although the Son, too, is given. For that the Son is given 
is from the Father's love, according to the words, "God so loved the 
world, as to give His only begotten Son" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++3:16">Jn. 3:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The name Gift involves the idea of belonging to the Giver 
through its origin; and thus it imports the property of the origin of the 
Holy Ghost---that is, His procession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[38] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Before a gift is given, it belongs only to the giver; but 
when it is given, it is his to whom it is given. Therefore, because 
"Gift" does not import the actual giving, it cannot be called a gift of 
man, but the Gift of God giving. When, however, it has been given, then 
it is the spirit of man, or a gift bestowed on man.<br>
