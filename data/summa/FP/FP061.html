<H3 Align="Center">OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE ANGELS IN THE ORDER OF NATURAL BEING (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; After dealing with the nature of the angels, their knowledge and will, 
it now remains for us to treat of their creation, or, speaking in a 
general way, of their origin. Such consideration is threefold. In the 
first place we must see how they were brought into natural existence; 
secondly, how they were made perfect in grace or glory; and thirdly, how 
some of them became wicked.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first heading there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FPQ61A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the angel has a cause of his existence? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FPQ61A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether he has existed from eternity?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#FPQ61A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether he was created before corporeal creatures?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels have no cause of their existence. 
For the first chapter of Genesis treats of things created by God. But 
there is no mention of angels. Therefore the angels were not created by 
God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Metaph. viii, text. 16) that if 
any substance be a form without matter, "straightway it has being and 
unity of itself, and has no cause of its being and unity." But the angels 
are immaterial forms, as was shown above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore they 
have no cause of their being.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever is produced by any agent, from the very fact of 
its being produced, receives form from it. But since the angels are 
forms, they do not derive their form from any agent. Therefore the angels 
have no active cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++148:2">Ps. 148:2</a>): "Praise ye Him, all His 
angels"; and further on, verse 5: "For He spoke and they were made."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It must be affirmed that angels and everything existing, 
except God, were made by God. God alone is His own existence; while in 
everything else the essence differs from the existence, as was shown 
above (<A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FP003.html#FPQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). From this it is clear that God alone exists of His 
own essence: while all other things have their existence by 
participation. Now whatever exists by participation is caused by what 
exists essentially; as everything ignited is caused by fire. Consequently 
the angels, of necessity, were made by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xi, 50) that the angels were 
not passed over in that account of the first creation of things, but are 
designated by the name "heavens" or of "light." And they were either 
passed over, or else designated by the names of corporeal things, because 
Moses was addressing an uncultured people, as yet incapable of 
understanding an incorporeal nature; and if it had been divulged that 
there were creatures existing beyond corporeal nature, it would have 
proved to them an occasion of idolatry, to which they were inclined, and 
from which Moses especially meant to safeguard them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Substances that are subsisting forms have no 'formal' cause 
of their existence and unity, nor such active cause as produces its 
effect by changing the matter from a state of potentiality to actuality; 
but they have a cause productive of their entire substance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this the solution of the third difficulty is manifest.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angel was produced by God from eternity. 
For God is the cause of the angel by His being: for He does not act 
through something besides His essence. But His being is eternal. 
Therefore He produced the angels from eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everything which exists at one period and not at 
another, is subject to time. But the angel is above time, as is laid down 
in the book De Causis. Therefore the angel is not at one time existing 
and at another non-existing, but exists always.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine (De Trin. xiii) proves the soul's 
incorruptibility by the fact that the mind is capable of truth. But as 
truth is incorruptible, so is it eternal. Therefore the intellectual 
nature of the soul and of the angel is not only incorruptible, but 
likewise eternal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++8:22">Prov. 8:22</a>), in the person of begotten 
Wisdom: "The Lord possessed me in the beginning of His ways, before He 
made anything from the beginning." But, as was shown above (<A Href="FP061.html#FPQ61A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the 
angels were made by God. Therefore at one time the angels were not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> God alone, Father, Son and Holy Ghost, is from eternity. 
Catholic Faith holds this without doubt; and everything to the contrary 
must be rejected as heretical. For God so produced creatures that He made 
them "from nothing"; that is, after they had not been.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God's being is His will. So the fact that God produced the 
angels and other creatures by His being does not exclude that He made 
them also by His will. But, as was shown above (<A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19OUTP1">Question [19]</a>, <A Href="FP019.html#FPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP046.html#FPQ46OUTP1">Question [46]</a>, <A Href="FP046.html#FPQ46A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), God's will does not act by necessity in producing creatures. Therefore 
He produced such as He willed, and when He willed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An angel is above that time which is the measure of the 
movement of the heavens; because he is above every movement of a 
corporeal nature. Nevertheless he is not above time which is the measure 
of the succession of his existence after his non-existence, and which is 
also the measure of the succession which is in his operations. Hence 
Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20,21) that "God moves the spiritual 
creature according to time."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Angels and intelligent souls are incorruptible by the very 
fact of their having a nature whereby they are capable of truth. But they 
did not possess this nature from eternity; it was bestowed upon them when 
God Himself willed it. Consequently it does not follow that the angels 
existed from eternity.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels were created before the corporeal world?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels were created before the corporeal 
world. For Jerome says (In Ep. ad Tit. i, 2): "Six thousand years of our 
time have not yet elapsed; yet how shall we measure the time, how shall 
we count the ages, in which the Angels, Thrones, Dominations, and the 
other orders served God?" Damascene also says (De Fide Orth. ii): "Some 
say that the angels were begotten before all creation; as Gregory the 
Theologian declares, He first of all devised the angelic and heavenly 
powers, and the devising was the making thereof."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angelic nature stands midway between the Divine and 
the corporeal natures. But the Divine nature is from eternity; while 
corporeal nature is from time. Therefore the angelic nature was produced 
ere time was made, and after eternity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the angelic nature is more remote from the corporeal 
nature than one corporeal nature is from another. But one corporeal 
nature was made before another; hence the six days of the production of 
things are set forth in the opening of Genesis. Much more, therefore, was 
the angelic nature made before every corporeal nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++1:1">Gn. 1:1</a>): "In the beginning God created 
heaven and earth." Now, this would not be true if anything had been 
created previously. Consequently the angels were not created before 
corporeal nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold opinion on this point to be found in 
the writings of the Fathers. The more probable one holds that the angels 
were created at the same time as corporeal creatures. For the angels are 
part of the universe: they do not constitute a universe of themselves; 
but both they and corporeal natures unite in constituting one universe. 
This stands in evidence from the relationship of creature to creature; 
because the mutual relationship of creatures makes up the good of the 
universe. But no part is perfect if separate from the whole. Consequently 
it is improbable that God, Whose "works are perfect," as it is said Dt. 
32:4, should have created the angelic creature before other creatures. At 
the same time the contrary is not to be deemed erroneous; especially on 
account of the opinion of Gregory Nazianzen, "whose authority in 
Christian doctrine is of such weight that no one has ever raised 
objection to his teaching, as is also the case with the doctrine of 
Athanasius," as Jerome says.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Jerome is speaking according to the teaching of the Greek 
Fathers; all of whom hold the creation of the angels to have taken place 
previously to that of the corporeal world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God is not a part of, but far above, the whole universe, 
possessing within Himself the entire perfection of the universe in a more 
eminent way. But an angel is a part of the  universe. Hence the 
comparison does not hold.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All corporeal creatures are one in matter; while the angels 
do not agree with them in matter. Consequently the creation of the matter 
of the corporeal creature involves in a manner the creation of all 
things; but the creation of the angels does not involve creation of the 
universe.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If the contrary view be held, then in the text of Gn. 1, "In the 
beginning God created heaven and earth," the words, "In the beginning," 
must be interpreted, "In the Son," or "In the beginning of time": but 
not, "In the beginning, before which there was nothing," unless we say 
"Before which there was nothing of the nature of corporeal creatures."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the angels were created in the empyrean heaven?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels were not created in the empyrean 
heaven. For the angels are incorporeal substances. Now a substance which 
is incorporeal is not dependent upon a body for its existence; and as a 
consequence, neither is it for its creation. Therefore the angels were 
not created in any corporeal place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine remarks (Gen. ad lit. iii, 10), that the 
angels were created in the upper atmosphere: therefore not in the 
empyrean heaven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the empyrean heaven is said to be the highest heaven. If 
therefore the angels were created in the empyrean heaven, it would not 
beseem them to mount up to a still higher heaven. And this is contrary to 
what is said in Isaias, speaking in the person of the sinning angel: "I 
will ascend into heaven" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++14:13">Is. 14:13</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Strabus, commenting on the text "In the beginning God 
created heaven and earth," says: "By heaven he does not mean the visible 
firmament, but the empyrean, that is, the fiery or intellectual 
firmament, which is not so styled from its heat, but from its splendor; 
and which was filled with angels directly it was made."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As was observed (<A Href="FP061.html#FPQ61A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), the universe is made up of 
corporeal and spiritual creatures. Consequently spiritual creatures were 
so created as to bear some relationship to the corporeal creature, and to 
rule over every corporeal creature. Hence it was fitting for the angels 
to be created in the highest corporeal place, as presiding over all 
corporeal nature; whether it be styled the empyrean heaven, or whatever 
else it be called. So Isidore says that the highest heaven is the heaven 
of the angels, explaining the passage of Dt. 10:14: "Behold heaven is the 
Lord's thy God, and the heaven of heaven."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The angels were created in a corporeal place, not  as if 
depending upon a body either as to their existence or as to their being 
made; because God could have created them before all corporeal creation, 
as many holy Doctors hold. They were made in a corporeal place in order 
to show their relationship to corporeal nature, and that they are by 
their power in touch with bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By the uppermost atmosphere Augustine possibly means the 
highest part of heaven, to which the atmosphere has a kind of affinity 
owing to its subtlety and transparency. Or else he is not speaking of all 
the angels; but only of such as sinned, who, in the opinion of some, 
belonged to the inferior orders. But there is nothing to hinder us from 
saying that the higher angels, as having an exalted and universal power 
over all corporeal things, were created in the highest place of the 
corporeal creature; while the other angels, as having more restricted 
powers, were created among the inferior bodies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[61] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Isaias is not speaking there of any corporeal heaven, but 
of the heaven of the Blessed Trinity; unto which the sinning angel wished 
to ascend, when he desired to be equal in some manner to God, as will 
appear later on (<A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="FP063.html#FPQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
