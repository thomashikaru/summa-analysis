<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels are not sent on works of ministry. 
For every mission is to some determinate place. But intellectual actions 
do not determine a place, for intellect abstracts from the "here" and 
"now." Since therefore the angelic actions are intellectual, it appears 
that the angels are not sent to perform their own actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the empyrean heaven is the place that beseems the 
angelic dignity. Therefore if they are sent to us in ministry, it seems 
that something of their dignity would be lost; which is unseemly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, external occupation hinders the contemplation of wisdom; 
hence it is said: "He that is less in action, shall receive wisdom" 
(Ecclus. 38:25). So if some angels are sent on external ministrations, 
they would seemingly be hindered from contemplation. But the whole of 
their beatitude consists in the contemplation of God. So if they were 
sent, their beatitude would be lessened; which is unfitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, to minister is the part of an inferior; hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++22:27">Lk. 22:27</a>): "Which is the greater, he that sitteth at table, or 
he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at table?" But the angels are 
naturally greater than we are. Therefore they are not sent to administer 
to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++23:20">Ex. 23:20</a>): "Behold I will send My 
angels who shall go before thee."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> From what has been said above (<A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108OUTP1">Question [108]</a>, <A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), it may be 
shown that some angels are sent in ministry by God. For, as we have 
already stated (<A Href="FP043.html#FPQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>, <A Href="FP043.html#FPQ43A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), in treating of the mission of the Divine 
Persons, he is said to be sent who in any way proceeds from another so as 
to begin to be where he was not, or to be in another way, where he 
already was. Thus the Son, or the Holy Ghost is said to be sent as 
proceeding from the Father by origin; and begins to be in a new way, by 
grace or by the nature assumed, where He was before by the presence of 
His Godhead; for it belongs to God to be present everywhere, because, 
since He is the universal agent, His power reaches to all being, and 
hence He exists in all things (<A Href="FP008.html#FPQ8OUTP1">Question [8]</a>,  <A Href="FP008.html#FPQ8A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). An angel's power, however, 
as a particular agent, does not reach to the whole universe, but reaches 
to one thing in such a way as not to reach another; and so he is "here" 
in such a manner as not to be "there." But it is clear from what was 
above stated (<A Href="FP110.html#FPQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>, <A Href="FP110.html#FPQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that the corporeal creature is governed by 
the angels. Hence, whenever an angel has to perform any work concerning a 
corporeal creature, the angel applies himself anew to that body by his 
power; and in that way begins to be there afresh. Now all this takes 
place by Divine command. Hence it follows that an angel is sent by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet the action performed by the angel who is sent, proceeds from God as 
from its first principle, at Whose nod and by Whose authority the angels 
work; and is reduced to God as to its last end. Now this is what is meant 
by a minister: for a minister is an intelligent instrument; while an 
instrument is moved by another, and its action is ordered to another. 
Hence angels' actions are called 'ministries'; and for this reason they 
are said to be sent in ministry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> An operation can be intellectual in two ways. In one way, 
as dwelling in the intellect itself, as contemplation; such an operation 
does not demand to occupy a place; indeed, as Augustine says (De Trin. 
iv, 20): "Even we ourselves as mentally tasting something eternal, are 
not in this world." In another sense an action is said to be intellectual 
because it is regulated and commanded by some intellect; in that sense 
the intellectual operations evidently have sometimes a determinate place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The empyrean heaven belongs to the angelic dignity by way 
of congruity; forasmuch as it is congruous that the higher body should be 
attributed to that nature which occupies a rank above bodies. Yet an 
angel does not derive his dignity from the empyrean heaven; so when he is 
not actually in the empyrean heaven, nothing of his dignity is lost, as 
neither does a king lessen his dignity when not actually sitting on his 
regal throne, which suits his dignity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In ourselves the purity of contemplation is obscured by 
exterior occupation; because we give ourselves to action through the 
sensitive faculties, the action of which when intense impedes the action 
of the intellectual powers. An angel, on the contrary, regulates his 
exterior actions by intellectual operation alone. Hence it follows that 
his external occupations in no respect impede his contemplation; because 
given two actions, one of which is the rule and the reason of the other, 
one does not hinder but helps the other. Wherefore Gregory says (Moral. 
ii) that "the angels do not go abroad in such a manner as to lose the 
delights of inward contemplation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In their external actions the angels chiefly minister to 
God, and secondarily to us; not because we are superior to them, 
absolutely speaking, but because, since every man or angel by cleaving to 
God is made one spirit with God, he is thereby  superior to every 
creature. Hence the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++2:3">Phil. 2:3</a>): "Esteeming others better 
than themselves."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the angels are sent in ministry. For the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++1:14">Heb. 1:14</a>): "All are ministering spirits, sent to minister" 
[Vulg. 'Are they not all . . . ?'].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, among the orders, the highest is that of the Seraphim, 
as stated above (<A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108OUTP1">Question [108]</a>, <A Href="FP108.html#FPQ108A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). But a Seraph was sent to purify the lips 
of the prophet (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++6:6,7">Is. 6:6,7</a>). Therefore much more are the inferior orders 
sent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Divine Persons infinitely excel all the angelic 
orders. But the Divine Persons are sent. Therefore much more are even the 
highest angels sent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the superior angels are not sent to the external 
ministries, this can only be because the superior angels execute the 
Divine ministries by means of the inferior angels. But as all the angels 
are unequal, as stated above (<A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="FP050.html#FPQ50A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), each angel has an angel 
inferior to himself except the last one. Therefore only the last angel 
would be sent in ministry; which contradicts the words, "Thousands of 
thousands ministered to Him" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++7:10">Dan. 7:10</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.), quoting the 
statement of Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xiii), that "the higher ranks fulfil 
no exterior service."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what has been said above (<A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="FP106.html#FPQ106A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="FP110.html#FPQ110OUTP1">Question [110]</a>, <A Href="FP110.html#FPQ110A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the order of Divine Providence has so disposed not only 
among the angels, but also in the whole universe, that inferior things 
are administered by the superior. But the Divine dispensation, however, 
this order is sometimes departed from as regards corporeal things, for 
the sake of a higher order, that is, according as it is suitable for the 
manifestation of grace. That the man born blind was enlightened, that 
Lazarus was raised from the dead, was accomplished immediately by God 
without the action of the heavenly bodies. Moreover both good and bad 
angels can work some effect in these bodies independently of the heavenly 
bodies, by the condensation of the clouds to rain, and by producing some 
such effects. Nor can anyone doubt that God can immediately reveal things 
to men without the help of the angels, and the superior angels without 
the inferior. From this standpoint some have said that according to the 
general law the superior angels are not sent, but only the inferior; yet 
that sometimes, by Divine dispensation, the superior angels also are sent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be said that the Apostle wishes to prove that Christ is 
greater than the angels who were chosen as the messengers of the law; in 
order that He might show the excellence of the new  over the old law. 
Hence there is no need to apply this to any other angels besides those 
who were sent to give the law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xiii), the angel who 
was sent to purify the prophet's lips was one of the inferior order; but 
was called a "Seraph," that is, "kindling " in an equivocal sense, 
because he came to "kindle" the lips of the prophet. It may also be said 
that the superior angels communicate their own proper gifts whereby they 
are denominated, through the ministry of the inferior angels. Thus one of 
the Seraphim is described as purifying by fire the prophet's lips, not as 
if he did so immediately, but because an inferior angel did so by his 
power; as the Pope is said to absolve a man when he gives absolution by 
means of someone else.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Divine Persons are not sent in ministry, but are said 
to be sent in an equivocal sense, as appears from what has been said 
(<A Href="FP043.html#FPQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>, <A Href="FP043.html#FPQ43A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A manifold grade exists in the Divine ministries. Hence 
there is nothing to prevent angels though unequal from being sent 
immediately in ministry, in such a manner however that the superior are 
sent to the higher ministries, and the lower to the inferior ministries.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all the angels who are sent, assist?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels who are sent also assist. For 
Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in Evang.): "So the angels are sent, and assist; 
for, though the angelic spirit is limited, yet the supreme Spirit, God, 
is not limited."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the angel was sent to administer to Tobias. Yet he said, 
"I am the angel Raphael, one of the seven who stand before the Lord" 
(Tob. 12:15). Therefore the angels who are sent, assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every holy angel is nearer to God than Satan is. Yet 
Satan assisted God, according to Job 1:6: "When the sons of God came to 
stand before the Lord, Satan also was present among them." Therefore much 
more do the angels, who are sent to minister, assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the inferior angels do not assist, the reason is 
because they receive the Divine enlightenment, not immediately, but 
through the superior angels. But every angel receives the Divine 
enlightenment from a superior, except the one who is highest of all. 
Therefore only the highest angel would assist; which is contrary to the 
text of Dan. 7:10: "Ten thousand times a hundred thousand stood before 
Him." Therefore the angels who are sent also assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says, on Job 25:3: "Is there any  numbering of 
His soldiers?" (Moral. xvii): "Those powers assist, who do not go forth 
as messengers to men." Therefore those who are sent in ministry do not 
assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The angels are spoken of as "assisting" and 
"administering," after the likeness of those who attend upon a king; some 
of whom ever wait upon him, and hear his commands immediately; while 
others there are to whom the royal commands are conveyed by those who are 
in attendance---for instance, those who are placed at the head of the 
administration of various cities; these are said to administer, not to 
assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore observe that all the angels gaze upon the Divine 
Essence immediately; in regard to which all, even those who minister, are 
said to assist. Hence Gregory says (Moral. ii) that "those who are sent 
on the external ministry of our salvation can always assist and see the 
face of the Father." Yet not all the angels can perceive the secrets of 
the Divine mysteries in the clearness itself of the Divine Essence; but 
only the superior angels who announce them to the inferior: and in that 
respect only the superior angels belonging to the highest hierarchy are 
said to assist, whose special prerogative it is to be enlightened 
immediately by God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this may be deduced the reply to the first and second objections, 
which are based on the first mode of assisting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Satan is not described as having assisted, but as present 
among the assistants; for, as Gregory says (Moral. ii), "though he has 
lost beatitude, still he has retained a nature like to the angels."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> All the assistants see some things immediately in the glory 
of the Divine Essence; and so it may be said that it is the prerogative 
of the whole of the highest hierarchy to be immediately enlightened by 
God; while the higher ones among them see more than is seen by the 
inferior; some of whom enlighten others: as also among those who assist 
the king, one knows more of the king's secrets than another.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all the angels of the second hierarchy are 
sent. For all the angels either assist, or minister, according to Dan. 
7:10. But the angels of the second hierarchy do not assist; for they are 
enlightened by the angels of the first hierarchy, as Dionysius says 
(Coel. Hier. viii). Therefore all the angels of the second hierarchy are 
sent in ministry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory says (Moral. xvii) that "there are more who

the second hierarchy were not sent in ministry. Therefore all the angels 
of the second hierarchy are sent to  minister.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. viii) that the "Dominations 
are above all subjection." But to be sent implies subjection. Therefore 
the dominations are not sent to minister.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As above stated (<A Href="FP112.html#FPQ112A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), to be sent to external ministry 
properly belongs to an angel according as he acts by Divine command in 
respect of any corporeal creature; which is part of the execution of the 
Divine ministry. Now the angelic properties are manifested by their 
names, as Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. vii); and therefore the angels of 
those orders are sent to external ministry whose names signify some kind 
of administration. But the name "dominations" does not signify any such 
administration, but only disposition and command in administering. On the 
other hand, the names of the inferior orders imply administration, for 
the "Angels" and "Archangels" are so called from "announcing"; the 
"Virtues" and "Powers" are so called in respect of some act; and it is 
right that the "Prince," according to what Gregory says (Hom. xxxiv in 
Evang.), "be first among the workers." Hence it belongs to these five 
orders to be sent to external ministry; not to the four superior orders.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Dominations are reckoned among the ministering angels, 
not as exercising but as disposing and commanding what is to be done by 
others; thus an architect does not put his hands to the production of his 
art, but only disposes and orders what others are to do.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A twofold reason may be given in assigning the number of 
the assisting and ministering angels. For Gregory says that those who 
minister are more numerous than those who assist; because he takes the 
words (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++7:10">Dan. 7:10</a>) "thousands of thousands ministered to Him," not in a 
multiple but in a partitive sense, to mean "thousands out of thousands"; 
thus the number of those who minister is indefinite, and signifies 
excess; while the number of assistants is finite as in the words added, 
"and ten thousand times a hundred thousand assisted Him." This 
explanation rests on the opinion of the Platonists, who said that the 
nearer things are to the one first principle, the smaller they are in 
number; as the nearer a number is to unity, the lesser it is than 
multitude. This opinion is verified as regards the number of orders, as 
six administer and three assist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FP Q[112] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Dionysius, however, (Coel. Hier. xiv) declares that the multitude of 
angels surpasses all the multitude of material things; so that, as the 
superior bodies exceed the inferior in magnitude to an immeasurable 
degree, so the superior incorporeal natures surpass all corporeal natures 
in multitude; because whatever is better is more intended and more 
multiplied by God. Hence, as the assistants are superior to the ministers 
there will be more assistants than ministers. In this way, the words 
"thousands of thousands" are taken by way of multiplication, to signify 
"a thousand times a thousand." And because ten times a hundred is a 
thousand, if it  were said "ten times a hundred thousand" it would mean 
that there are as many assistants as ministers: but since it is written 
"ten thousand times a hundred thousand," we are given to understand that 
the assistants are much more numerous than the ministers. Nor is this 
said to signify that this is the precise number of angels, but rather 
that it is much greater, in that it exceeds all material multitude. This 
is signified by the multiplication together of all the greatest numbers, 
namely ten, a hundred, and a thousand, as Dionysius remarks in the same 
passage.<br>
