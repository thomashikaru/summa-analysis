</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sanctifying grace is not conferred in the 
sacrament of Order. For it is commonly agreed that the sacrament of Order 
is directed to counteract the defect of ignorance. Now not sanctifying 
grace but gratuitous grace is given to counteract ignorance, for 
sanctifying grace has more to do with  the will. Therefore sanctifying 
grace is not given in the sacrament of Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Order implies distinction. Now the members of the Church 
are distinguished, not by sanctifying but by gratuitous grace, of which 
it is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++12:4">1 Cor. 12:4</a>): "There are diversities of graces." Therefore 
sanctifying grace is not given in order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no cause presupposes its effect. But grace is 
presupposed in one who receives orders, so that he may be worthy to 
receive them. Therefore this same grace is not given in the conferring of 
Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The sacraments of the New Law cause what they signify. 
Now Order by its sevenfold number signifies the seven gifts of the Holy 
Ghost, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Therefore the gifts of 
the Holy Ghost, which are not apart from sanctifying grace, are given in 
Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Order is a sacrament of the New Law. Now the definition of a 
sacrament of that kind includes the words, "that it may be a cause of 
grace." Therefore it causes grace in the recipient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; I answer that The works of God are perfect (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++32:4">Dt. 32:4</a>); and consequently 
whoever receives power from above receives also those things that render 
him competent to exercise that power. This is also the case in natural 
things, since animals are provided with members, by which their soul's 
powers are enabled to proceed to their respective actions unless there be 
some defect on the part of matter. Now just as sanctifying grace is 
necessary in order that man receive the sacraments worthily, so is it 
that he may dispense them worthily. Wherefore as in Baptism, whereby a 
man is adapted to receive the other sacraments, sanctifying grace is 
given, so is it in the sacrament of Order whereby man is ordained to the 
dispensation of the other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Order is given as a remedy, not to one person but to the 
whole Church. Hence, although it is said to be given in order to 
counteract ignorance, it does not mean that by receiving Orders a man has 
his ignorance driven out of him, but that the recipient of Orders is set 
in authority to expel ignorance from among the people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the gifts of sanctifying grace are common to all 
the members of the Church, nevertheless a man cannot be the worthy 
recipient of those gifts, in respect of which the members of the Church 
are distinguished from one another, unless he have charity, and this 
cannot be apart from sanctifying grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The worthy exercise of Orders requires not any kind of 
goodness but excellent goodness, in order that as they who receive orders 
are set above the people in the degree of Order, so may they be above 
them by the merit of holiness. Hence they are  required to have the grace 
that suffices to make them worthy members of Christ's people, but when 
they receive Orders they are given a yet greater gift of grace, whereby 
they are rendered apt for greater things.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the sacrament of Order a character is imprinted in connection with all the Orders?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in the sacrament of Order a character is not 
imprinted in connection with all the Orders. For the character of Order 
is a spiritual power. Now some Orders are directed only to certain bodily 
acts, for instance those of the doorkeeper or of the acolyte. Therefore a 
character is not imprinted in these Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every character is indelible. Therefore a character 
places a man in a state whence he cannot withdraw. Now those who have 
certain Orders can lawfully return to the laity. Therefore a character is 
not imprinted in all the Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by means of a character a man is appointed to give or to 
receive some sacred thing. Now a man is sufficiently adapted to the 
reception of the sacraments by the character of Baptism, and a man is not 
appointed to dispense the sacraments except in the Order of priesthood. 
Therefore a character is not imprinted in the other Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Every sacrament in which a character is not imprinted 
can be repeated. But no Order can be repeated. Therefore a character is 
imprinted in each Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, a character is a distinctive sign. Now there is something 
distinct in every Order. Therefore every Order imprints a character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There have been three opinions on this point. For some 
have said that a character is imprinted only in the Order of priesthood; 
but this is not true, since none but a deacon can exercise the act of the 
diaconate, and so it is clear that in the dispensation of the sacraments, 
he has a spiritual power which others have not. For this reason others 
have said that a character is impressed in the sacred, but not in the 
minor, Orders. But this again comes to nothing, since each Order sets a 
man above the people in some degree of authority directed to the 
dispensation of the sacraments. Wherefore since a character is a sign 
whereby one thing is distinguished from another, it follows that a 
character is imprinted in each Order. And this is confirmed by the fact 
that they remain for ever and are never repeated. This is the third and 
more common opinion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Each Order either has an act connected with the sacrament 
itself, or adapts a man to the dispensation of the sacraments; thus 
doorkeepers exercise the act of admitting men to  witness the Divine 
sacraments, and so forth; and consequently a spiritual power is required 
in each.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> For all that a man may return to the laity, the character 
always remains in him. This is evident from the fact that if he return to 
the clerical state, he does not receive again the order which he had 
already.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection is the same as to the First.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the character of Order presupposes the baptismal character?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the character of Order does not presuppose the 
character of Baptism. For the character of Order makes a man a dispenser 
of the sacraments; while the character of Baptism makes him a recipient 
of them. Now active power does not necessarily presuppose passive power, 
for it can be without it, as in God. Therefore the character of Order 
does not necessarily presuppose the character of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man is not baptized, and yet think 
with probability that he has been baptized. If therefore such a person 
present himself for Orders, he will not receive the character of Order, 
supposing the character of Order to presuppose the character of Baptism; 
and consequently whatever he does by way of consecration or absolution 
will be invalid, and the Church will be deceived therein, which is 
inadmissible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Baptism is the door of the sacraments. Therefore since 
Order is a sacrament, it presupposes Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> No one can receive what he has not the power to receive. 
Now the character of Baptism gives a man the power to receive the other 
sacraments. Wherefore he that has not the baptismal character, can 
receive no other sacrament; and consequently the character of Order 
presupposes the character of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In one who has active power of himself, the active does not 
presuppose the passive power; but in one who has active power from 
another, passive power, whereby he is enabled to receive the active 
power, is prerequisite to active power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Such a man if he be ordained to the priesthood is not a 
priest, and he can neither consecrate, nor absolve in the tribunal of 
Penance. Wherefore according to the canons he must be baptized, and 
reordained (Extra De Presbyt. non Bapt., cap. Si quis; cap. Veniens). And 
even though he be raised to the episcopate, those whom he ordains receive 
not the Order. Yet it may piously be believed that as regards the 
ultimate effects of the sacraments, the High Priest will supply the 
defect, and that He would not allow this to be so hidden as to endanger 
the Church.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the character of Order necessarily presupposes the character of Confirmation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the character of Order necessarily presupposes 
the character of Confirmation. For in things subordinate to one another, 
as the middle presupposes the first, so does the last presuppose the 
middle. Now the character of Confirmation presupposes that of Baptism as 
being the first. Therefore the character of Order presupposes that of 
Confirmation as being in the middle.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who are appointed to confirm should themselves be 
most firm. Now those who receive the sacrament of Order are appointed to 
confirm others. Therefore they especially should have received the 
sacrament of Confirmation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The apostles received the power of order before the 
Ascension (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++20:22">Jn. 20:22</a>), where it is said: "Receive the Holy Ghost." But 
they were confirmed after the Ascension by the coming of the Holy Ghost. 
Therefore order does not presuppose Confirmation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> For the reception of Orders something is prerequisite for 
the validity of the sacrament, and something as congruous to the 
sacrament. For the validity of the sacrament it is required that one who 
presents himself for Orders should be capable of receiving them, and this 
is competent to him through Baptism; wherefore the baptismal character is 
prerequisite for the validity of the sacrament, so that the sacrament of 
Order cannot be conferred without it. On the other hand, as congruous to 
the sacrament a man is required to have every perfection whereby he 
becomes adapted to the exercise of Orders, and one of these is that he be 
confirmed. Wherefore the character of Order presupposes the character of 
Confirmation as congruous but not as necessary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this case the middle does not stand in the same relation 
to the last as the first to the middle, because the character of Baptism 
enables a man to receive the sacrament of Confirmation, whereas the 
character of Confirmation does not enable a man to receive the sacrament 
of Order. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers aptness by way of congruity.

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the character of one Order necessarily 
presupposes the character of another Order. For there is more in common 
between one Order and another, than between Order and another sacrament. 
But the character of Order presupposes the character of another 
sacrament, namely Baptism. Much more therefore  does the character of one 
Order presuppose the character of another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Orders are degrees of a kind. Now no one can reach a 
further degree, unless he first mount the previous degree. Therefore no 
one can receive the character of a subsequent Order unless he has first 
received the preceding Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> If anything necessary for a sacrament be omitted in 
that sacrament, the sacrament must be repeated. But if one receive a 
subsequent Order, without receiving a preceding Order, he is not 
reordained, but he receives what was lacking, according to the canonical 
statutes (cap. Tuae literae, De clerico per salt. prom.). Therefore the 
preceding Order is not necessary for the following.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is not necessary for the higher Orders that one should 
have received the minor Orders, because their respective powers are 
distinct, and one, considered in its essentials, does not require another 
in the same subject. Hence even in the early Church some were ordained 
priests without having previously received the lower Orders and yet they 
could do all that the lower Orders could, because the lower power is 
comprised in the higher, even as sense in understanding, and dukedom in 
kingdom. Afterwards, however, it was decided by the legislation of the 
Church that no one should present himself to the higher orders who had 
not previously humbled himself in the lower offices. And hence it is that 
according to the Canons (cap. Tuae literae, De clerico per salt. prom.) 
those who are ordained without receiving a preceding Order are not 
reordained, but receive what was lacking to them of the preceding Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Orders have more in common with one another as regards 
specific likeness, than order has with Baptism. But as regards proportion 
of power to action, Baptism has more in common with Order, than one Order 
with another, because Baptism confers on man the passive power to receive 
Orders, whereas a lower Order does not give him the passive power to 
receive higher Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[35] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Orders are not degrees combining in one action or in one 
movement, so that it be necessary to reach the last through the first; 
but they are like degrees consisting in things of different kinds, such 
as the degrees between man and angel, and it is not necessary that one 
who is an angel be first of all a man. Such also are the degrees between 
the head and all members of the body; nor is it necessary that that which 
is the head should be previously a foot; and thus it is in the case in 
point.<br>
