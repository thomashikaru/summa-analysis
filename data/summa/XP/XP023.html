<H3 Align="Center">OF COMMUNICATION WITH EXCOMMUNICATED PERSONS (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider communication with those who are  excommunicated. 
Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ23A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is lawful to communicate in matters purely corporal with 
one who is excommunicated?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ23A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether one who communicates with an excommunicated person is 
excommunicated?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ23A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is always a mortal sin to communicate with an 
excommunicated person in matters not permitted by law?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is lawful, in matters purely corporal, to 
communicate with an excommunicated person. For excommunication is an act 
of the keys. But the power of the keys extends only to spiritual matters. 
Therefore excommunication does not prevent one from communicating with 
another in matters corporal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "What is instituted for the sake of charity, does not 
militate against charity" (Cf. <A Href="XP011.html#XPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>, <A Href="XP011.html#XPQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [1]). But we are bound by 
the precept of charity to succor our enemies, which is impossible without 
some sort of communication. Therefore it is lawful to communicate with an 
excommunicated person in corporal matters.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++5:11">1 Cor. 5:11</a>): "With such an one not so 
much as to eat."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Excommunication is twofold: there is minor 
excommunication, which deprives a man merely of a share in the 
sacraments, but not of the communion of the faithful. Wherefore it is 
lawful to communicate with a person lying under an excommunication of 
this kind, but not to give him the sacraments. The other is major 
excommunication which deprives a man of the sacraments of the Church and 
of the communion of the faithful. Wherefore it is not lawful to 
communicate with one who lies under such an excommunication. But, since 
the Church resorts to excommunication to repair and not to destroy, 
exception is made from this general law, in certain matters wherein 
communication is lawful, viz. in those which concern salvation, for one 
is allowed to speak of such matters with an excommunicated person; and 
one may even speak of other matters so as to put him at his ease and to 
make the words of salvation more acceptable. Moreover exception is made 
in favor of certain people whose business it is to be in attendance on 
the excommunicated person, viz. his wife, child, slave, vassal or 
subordinate. This, however, is to be understood of children who have not 
attained their majority, else they are forbidden to communicate with 
their father: and as to the others, the exception applies to them if they 
have entered his service before his excommunication, but not if they did 
so afterwards.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some understand this exception to apply in the opposite way, viz. that 
the master can communicate with his subjects: while others hold the 
contrary. At any rate it is lawful for them to  communicate with others 
in matters wherein they are under an obligation to them, for just as 
subjects are bound to serve their master, so is the master bound to look 
after his subjects. Again certain cases are excepted; as when the fact of 
the excommunication is unknown, or in the case of strangers or travelers 
in the country of those who are excommunicated, for they are allowed to 
buy from them, or to receive alms from them. Likewise if anyone were to 
see an excommunicated person in distress: for then he would be bound by 
the precept of charity to assist him. These are all contained in the 
following line: "Utility, law, lowliness, ignorance of fact, necessity," 
where "utility" refers to salutary words, "law" to marriage, "lowliness" 
to subjection. The others need no explanation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Corporal matters are subordinate to spiritual matters. 
Wherefore the power which extends to spiritual things, can also extend to 
matters touching the body: even as the art which considers the end 
commands in matters ordained to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In a case where one is bound by the precept of charity to 
hold communication, the prohibition ceases, as is clear from what has 
been said.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a person incurs excommunication for communicating with one who is excommunicated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a person does not incur excommunication for 
communicating with one who is excommunicated. For a heathen or a Jew is 
more separated from the Church than a person who is excommunicated. But 
one does not incur excommunication for communicating with a heathen or a 
Jew. Neither, therefore, does one for communicating with an 
excommunicated Christian.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a man incurs excommunication for communicating with 
an excommunicated person, for the same reason a third would incur 
excommunication for communicating with him, and thus one might go on 
indefinitely, which would seem absurd. Therefore one does not incur 
excommunication for communicating with one who is excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> An excommunicated person is banished from communion. 
Therefore whoever communicates with him leaves the communion of the 
Church: and hence he seems to be excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A person may incur excommunication in two ways. First, so 
that the excommunication includes both himself and whosoever communicates 
with him: and then, without any doubt, whoever communicates with him, 
incurs a major excommunication. Secondly, so that the excommunication is 
simply pronounced on him; and then a man may communicate with him either 
in his crime, by counsel, help or favor, in which case again he incurs 
the major excommunication, or he may communicate with him in other things 
by  speaking to him, greeting him, or eating with him, in which case he 
incurs the minor excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Church has no intention of correcting unbelievers as 
well as the faithful who are under her care: hence she does not sever 
those, whom she excommunicates, from the fellowship of unbelievers, as 
she does from the communion of the faithful over whom she exercises a 
certain power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is lawful to hold communion with one who has incurred a 
minor excommunication, so that excommunication does not pass on to a 
third person.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is always a mortal sin to communicate with an excommunicated person in other cases than those in which it is allowed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is always a mortal sin to hold communion 
with an excommunicated person in other cases than those in which it is 
allowed. Because a certain decretal (Cap. Sacris: De his quae vi, metuve, 
etc.) declares that "not even through fear of death should anyone hold 
communion with an excommunicated person, since one ought to die rather 
than commit a mortal sin." But this would be no reason unless it were 
always a mortal sin to hold communion with an excommunicated person. 
Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a mortal sin to act against a commandment of the 
Church. But the Church forbids anyone to hold communion with an 
excommunicated person. Therefore it is a mortal sin to hold communion 
with one who is excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man is debarred from receiving the Eucharist on 
account of a venial sin. But a man who holds communion with an 
excommunicated person, outside those cases in which it is allowed, is 
debarred from receiving the Eucharist, since he incurs a minor 
excommunication. Therefore it is a mortal sin to hold communion with an 
excommunicated person, save in those cases in which it is allowed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no one should incur a major excommunication save for a 
mortal sin. Now according to the law (Can. Praecipue, seqq., caus. xi) a 
man may incur a major excommunication for holding communion with an 
excommunicated person. Therefore it is a mortal sin to hold communion 
with one who is excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> None can absolve a man from mortal sin unless he have 
jurisdiction over him. But any priest can absolve a man for holding 
communion with those who are excommunicated. Therefore it is not a mortal 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the measure of the penalty should be according to the measure 
of the sin, as stated in Dt. 25:3. Now the punishment appointed by common 
custom for holding communion with an  excommunicated person is not that 
which is inflicted for mortal sin, but rather that which is due for 
venial sin. Therefore it is not a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some hold that it is always a mortal sin to hold 
communion with an excommunicated person, by word or in any of the 
forbidden ways mentioned above (<A Href="XP023.html#XPQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), except in those cases allowed by 
law (Cap. Quoniam). But since it seems very hard that a man should be 
guilty of a mortal sin by uttering just a slight word to an 
excommunicated person, and that by excommunicating a person one would 
endanger the salvation of many, and lay a snare which might turn to one's 
own hurt, it seems to others more probable that he is not always guilty 
of a mortal sin, but only when he holds communion with him in a criminal 
deed, or in an act of Divine worship, or through contempt of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This decretal is speaking of holding communion in Divine 
worship. It may also be replied that the same reason applies both to 
mortal and venial sin, since just as one cannot do well by committing a 
mortal sin, so neither can one by committing a venial sin: so that just 
as it is a man's duty to suffer death rather than commit a mortal sin, so 
is it his duty to do so sooner than commit a venial sin, inasmuch as it 
is his duty to avoid venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The commandment of the Church regards spiritual matters 
directly, and legitimate actions as a consequence: hence by holding 
communion in Divine worship one acts against the commandment, and commits 
a mortal sin; but by holding communion in other matters, one acts beside 
the commandment, and sins venially.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes a man is debarred from the Eucharist even without 
his own fault, as in the case of those who are suspended or under an 
interdict, because these penalties are sometimes inflicted on one person 
for the sin of another who is thus punished.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although it is a venial sin to hold communion with one who 
is excommunicated, yet to do so obstinately is a mortal sin: and for this 
reason one may be excommunicated according to the law.<br>
