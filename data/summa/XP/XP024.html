<H3 Align="Center">OF ABSOLUTION FROM EXCOMMUNICATION (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider absolution from excommunication: under which head 
there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ24A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any priest can absolve his subject from excommunication?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ24A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a man can be absolved from excommunication against his will?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#XPQ24A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a man can be absolved from one excommunication without being 
absolved from another?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that any priest can absolve his subject from 
excommunication. For the chains of sin are stronger than those of 
excommunication. But any priest can absolve his subject from sin. 
Therefore much more can he absolve him from excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if the cause is removed the effect is removed. But the 
cause of excommunication is a mortal sin. Therefore since any priest can 
absolve (his subject) from that mortal sin, he is able likewise to 
absolve him from the excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It belongs to the same power to excommunicate as to 
absolve from excommunication. But priests of inferior degree cannot 
excommunicate their subjects. Neither, therefore, can they absolve them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Anyone can absolve from minor excommunication who can 
absolve from the sin of participation in the sin of another. But in the 
case of a major excommunication, this is pronounced either by a judge, 
and then he who pronounced sentence or his superior can absolve---or it 
is pronounced by law, and then the bishop or even a priest can absolve 
except in the six cases which the Pope, who is the maker of laws, 
reserves to himself: the first is the case of a man who lays hands on a 
cleric or a religious; the second is of one who breaks into a church and 
is denounced for so doing; the third is of the man who sets fire to a 
church and is denounced for the deed; the fourth is of one who knowingly 
communicates in the Divine worship with those whom the Pope has 
excommunicated by name; the fifth is the case of one who tampers with the 
letters of the Holy See; the sixth is the case of one who communicates in 
a crime of one who is excommunicated. For he should not be absolved 
except by the person who excommunicated him, even though he be not 
subject to him, unless, by reason of the difficulty of appearing before 
him, he be absolved by the bishop or by his own priest, after binding 
himself by oath to submit to the command of the judge who pronounced the 
excommunication on him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are however eight exceptions to the first case: (1) In the hour of 
death, when a person can be absolved by any priest from any 
excommunication; (2) if the striker be the doorkeeper of a man in 
authority, and the blow be given neither through hatred nor of set 
purpose; (3) if the striker be a woman; (4) if the striker be a servant, 
whose master is not at fault and would suffer from his absence; (5) if a 
religious strike a religious, unless he strike him very grievously; (6) 
if the striker be a poor man; (7) if he be a minor, an old man, or an 
invalid; (8) if there be a deadly feud between them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, besides, seven cases in which the person who strikes a cleric 
does not incur excommunication: (1) if he do it for the sake of 
discipline, as a teacher or a superior; (2) if it be done for fun; (3) if 
the striker find the cleric behaving with impropriety towards his wife 
his mother, his sister or his daughter; (4) if he return blow for blow at 
once; (5) if the  striker be not aware that he is striking a cleric; (6) 
if the latter be guilty of apostasy after the triple admonition; (7) if 
the cleric exercise an act which is altogether contrary to the clerical 
life, e.g. if he become a soldier, or if he be guilty of bigamy [*Namely, 
that which is known by canonists as "similar bigamy"].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the chains of sin are in themselves greater than 
those of excommunication, yet in a certain respect the chains of 
excommunication are greater, inasmuch as they bind a man not only in the 
sight of God, but also in the eye of the Church. Hence absolution from 
excommunication requires jurisdiction in the external forum, whereas 
absolution from sin does not. Nor is there need of giving one's word by 
oath, as in the case of absolution from excommunication, because, as the 
Apostle declares (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++6:16">Heb. 6:16</a>), controversies between men are decided by 
oath.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As an excommunicated person has no share in the sacraments 
of the Church, a priest cannot absolve him from his guilt, unless he be 
first absolved from excommunication.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether anyone can be absolved against his will?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no man can be absolved against his will. For 
spiritual things are not conferred on anyone against his will. Now 
absolution from excommunication is a spiritual favor. Therefore it cannot 
be granted to a man against his will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the cause of excommunication is contumacy. But when, 
through contempt of the excommunication, a man is unwilling to be 
absolved, he shows a high degree of contumacy. Therefore he cannot be 
absolved.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Excommunication can be pronounced on a man against his 
will. Now things that happen to a man against his will, can be removed 
from him against his will, as in the case of the goods of fortune. 
Therefore excommunication can be removed from a man against his will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Evil of fault and evil of punishment differ in this, that 
the origin of fault is within us, since all sin is voluntary, whereas the 
origin of punishment is sometimes without, since punishment does not need 
to be voluntary, in fact the nature of punishment is rather to be against 
the will. Wherefore, just as a man commits no sin except willingly, so no 
sin is forgiven him against his will. On the other hand just as a person 
can be excommunicated against his will, so can he be absolved therefrom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The assertion is true of those spiritual goods which depend 
on our will, such as the virtues, which we cannot lose unwillingly; for 
knowledge, although a spiritual good, can be lost by a man against his 
will through sickness. Hence the argument is not to the point. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is possible for excommunication to be removed from a man 
even though he be contumacious, if it seem to be for the good of the man 
for whom the excommunication was intended as a medicine.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man can be absolved from one excommunication without being absolved from all?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man cannot be absolved from one 
excommunication without being absolved from all. For an effect should be 
proportionate to its cause. Now the cause of excommunication is a sin. 
Since then a man cannot be absolved from one sin without being absolved 
from all, neither can this happen as regards excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, absolution from excommunication is pronounced in the 
Church. But a man who is under the ban of one excommunication is outside 
the Church. Therefore so long as one remains, a man cannot be loosed from 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Excommunication is a punishment. Now a man can be 
loosed from one punishment, while another remains. Therefore a man can be 
loosed from one excommunication and yet remain under another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Excommunications are not connected together in any way, 
and so it is possible for a man to be absolved from one, and yet remain 
under another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be observed however that sometimes a man lies under several 
excommunications pronounced by one judge; and then, when he is absolved 
from one, he is understood to be absolved from all, unless the contrary 
be expressed, or unless he ask to be absolved from excommunication on one 
count only, whereas he was excommunicated under several. On the other 
hand sometimes a man lies under several sentences of excommunication 
pronounced by several judges; and then, when absolved from one 
excommunication, he is not therefore absolved from the others, unless at 
his prayer they all confirm his absolution, or unless they all depute one 
to absolve him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All sins are connected together in aversion from God, which 
is incompatible with the forgiveness of sin: wherefore one sin cannot be 
forgiven without another. But excommunications have no such connection. 
Nor again is absolution from excommunication hindered by contrariety of 
the will, as stated above (<A Href="XP024.html#XPQ24A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Hence the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[24] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as such a man was for several reasons outside the 
Church so is it possible for his separation to be removed on one count 
and to remain on another.<br>
