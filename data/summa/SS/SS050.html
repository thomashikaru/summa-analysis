<H3 Align="Center">OF THE SUBJECTIVE PARTS OF PRUDENCE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, in due sequence, consider the subjective parts of prudence. And 
since we have already spoken of the prudence with which a man rules 
himself (Question [47], seqq.), it remains for us to discuss the species of 
prudence whereby a multitude is governed. Under this head there are four 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ50A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a species of prudence is regnative?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ50A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether political and (3) domestic economy are species of prudence?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ50A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether military prudence is?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that regnative should not be reckoned a species of 
prudence. For regnative prudence is directed to the preservation of 
justice, since according to Ethic. v, 6 the prince is the guardian of 
justice. Therefore regnative prudence belongs to justice rather than to 
prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Polit. iii, 5) a kingdom 
[regnum] is one of six species of government. But no species of prudence 
is ascribed to the other five forms of government, which are 
"aristocracy," "polity," also called "timocracy" [*Cf. Ethic. viii, 10], 
"tyranny," "oligarchy" and "democracy." Therefore neither should a 
regnative species be ascribed to a kingdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, lawgiving belongs not only to kings, but also to certain 
others placed in authority, and even to the people, according to Isidore 
(Etym. v). Now the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 8) reckons a part of prudence 
to be "legislative." Therefore it is not becoming to substitute regnative 
prudence in its place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Polit. iii, 11) that "prudence is 
a virtue which is proper to the prince." Therefore a special kind of 
prudence is regnative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,10), it belongs to prudence 
to govern and command, so that wherever in human acts we find a special 
kind of governance and command, there must be a special kind of prudence. 
Now it is evident that there is a special and perfect kind of governance 
in one who has to govern not only himself but also the perfect community 
of a city or kingdom; because a government is the more perfect according 
as it is more universal, extends to more matters, and attains a higher 
end. Hence prudence in its special and most perfect sense, belongs to a 
king who is charged with the government of a city or kingdom: for which 
reason a species of prudence is reckoned to be regnative.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All matters connected with moral virtue belong to prudence 
as their guide, wherefore "right reason in accord with prudence" is 
included in the definition of moral virtue, as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS058.html#FSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS058.html#FSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4). For this reason also the execution of 
justice in so far as it is directed to the common good, which is part of 
the kingly office, needs the guidance of prudence. Hence these two 
virtues---prudence and justice---belong most properly to a king, 
according to Jer. 23:5: "A king shall reign and shall be wise, and shall 
execute justice and judgment in the earth." Since, however, direction 
belongs rather to the king, and execution to his subjects, regnative 
prudence is reckoned a species of prudence which is directive, rather 
than to justice which is executive.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A kingdom is the best of all governments, as stated in 
Ethic. viii, 10: wherefore the species of prudence should be denominated 
rather from a kingdom, yet so as to comprehend under regnative all other 
rightful forms of government, but not perverse forms which are opposed to 
virtue, and which, accordingly, do not pertain to prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Philosopher names regnative prudence after the 
principal act of a king which is to make laws, and although this applies 
to the other forms of government, this is only in so far as they have a 
share of kingly government.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether political prudence is fittingly accounted a part of prudence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that political prudence is not fittingly accounted 
a part of prudence. For regnative is a part of political prudence, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS050.html#SSQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But a part should not be reckoned a species with the 
whole. Therefore political prudence should not be reckoned a part of 
prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the species of habits are distinguished by their various 
objects. Now what the ruler has to command is the same as what the 
subject has to execute. Therefore political prudence as regards the 
subjects, should not be reckoned a species of prudence distinct from 
regnative prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, each subject is an individual person. Now each 
individual person can direct himself sufficiently by prudence commonly so 
called. Therefore there is no need of a special kind of prudence called 
political.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. vi, 8) that "of the 
prudence which is concerned with the state one kind is a master-prudence 
and is called legislative; another kind bears the common name political, 
and deals with individuals."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A slave is moved by his master, and a subject by his 
ruler, by command, but otherwise than as irrational and inanimate beings 
are set in motion by their movers. For irrational and inanimate beings 
are moved only by others and do not put themselves in motion, since they 
have no free-will whereby to be masters of their own actions, wherefore 
the rectitude of their government is not in their power but in the power 
of their movers. On the other hand, men who are slaves or subjects in any 
sense, are moved by the commands of others in such a way that they move 
themselves by their free-will; wherefore some kind of rectitude of 
government is required in them, so that they may direct themselves in 
obeying their superiors; and to this belongs that species of prudence 
which is called political.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above, regnative is the most perfect species of 
prudence, wherefore the prudence of subjects, which falls short of 
regnative prudence, retains the common name of political prudence, even 
as in logic a convertible term which does not denote the essence of a 
thing retains the name of "proper."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A different aspect of the object diversifies the species of 
a habit, as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now the same actions are 
considered by the king, but under a more general aspect, as by his 
subjects who obey: since many obey one king in various departments. Hence 
regnative prudence is compared to this political prudence of which we are 
speaking, as mastercraft to handicraft.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man directs himself by prudence commonly so called, in 
relation to his own good, but by political prudence, of which we speak, 
he directs himself in relation to the common good.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a part of prudence should be reckoned to be domestic?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that domestic should not be reckoned a part of 
prudence. For, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 5) "prudence is 
directed to a good life in general": whereas domestic prudence is 
directed to a particular end, viz. wealth, according to Ethic. i, 1. 
Therefore a species of prudence is not domestic.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated above (<A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47OUTP1">Question [47]</a>, <A Href="SS047.html#SSQ47A13THEP1">Article [13]</a>) prudence is only in good 
people. But domestic prudence may be also in wicked people, since many 
sinners are provident in governing their household. Therefore domestic 
prudence should not be reckoned a species of  prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as in a kingdom there is a ruler and subject, so 
also is there in a household. If therefore domestic like political is a 
species of prudence, there should be a paternal corresponding to 
regnative prudence. Now there is no such prudence. Therefore neither 
should domestic prudence be accounted a species of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 8) that there are 
various kinds of prudence in the government of a multitude, "one of which 
is domestic, another legislative, and another political."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Different aspects of an object, in respect of 
universality and particularity, or of totality and partiality, diversify 
arts and virtues; and in respect of such diversity one act of virtue is 
principal as compared with another. Now it is evident that a household is 
a mean between the individual and the city or kingdom, since just as the 
individual is part of the household, so is the household part of the city 
or kingdom. And therefore, just as prudence commonly so called which 
governs the individual, is distinct from political prudence, so must 
domestic prudence be distinct from both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Riches are compared to domestic prudence, not as its last 
end, but as its instrument, as stated in Polit. i, 3. On the other hand, 
the end of political prudence is "a good life in general" as regards the 
conduct of the household. In Ethic. i, 1 the Philosopher speaks of riches 
as the end of political prudence, by way of example and in accordance 
with the opinion of many.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some sinners may be provident in certain matters of detail 
concerning the disposition of their household, but not in regard to "a 
good life in general" as regards the conduct of the household, for which 
above all a virtuous life is required.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The father has in his household an authority like that of a 
king, as stated in Ethic. viii, 10, but he has not the full power of a 
king, wherefore paternal government is not reckoned a distinct species of 
prudence, like regnative prudence.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether military prudence should be reckoned a part of prudence?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that military prudence should not be reckoned a 
part of prudence. For prudence is distinct from art, according to Ethic. 
vi, 3. Now military prudence seems to be the art of warfare, according to 
the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 8). Therefore military prudence should not 
be accounted a species of prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as military business is contained under political 
affairs, so too are many other matters, such as those of  tradesmen, 
craftsmen, and so forth. But there are no species of prudence 
corresponding to other affairs in the state. Neither therefore should any 
be assigned to military business.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the soldiers' bravery counts for a great deal in 
warfare. Therefore military prudence pertains to fortitude rather than to 
prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++24:6">Prov. 24:6</a>): "War is managed by due 
ordering, and there shall be safety where there are many counsels." Now 
it belongs to prudence to take counsel. Therefore there is great need in 
warfare for that species of prudence which is called "military."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever things are done according to art or reason, 
should be made to conform to those which are in accordance with nature, 
and are established by the Divine Reason. Now nature has a twofold 
tendency: first, to govern each thing in itself, secondly, to withstand 
outward assailants and corruptives: and for this reason she has provided 
animals not only with the concupiscible faculty, whereby they are moved 
to that which is conducive to their well-being, but also with the 
irascible power, whereby the animal withstands an assailant. Therefore in 
those things also which are in accordance with reason, there should be 
not only "political" prudence, which disposes in a suitable manner such 
things as belong to the common good, but also a "military" prudence, 
whereby hostile attacks are repelled.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Military prudence may be an art, in so far as it has 
certain rules for the right use of certain external things, such as arms 
and horses, but in so far as it is directed to the common good, it 
belongs rather to prudence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Other matters in the state are directed to the profit of 
individuals, whereas the business of soldiering is directed to the 
service belongs to fortitude, but the direction, protection of the entire 
common good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[50] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The execution of military service belongs to fortitude, but 
the direction, especially in so far as it concerns the 
commander-in-chief, belongs to prudence.<br>
