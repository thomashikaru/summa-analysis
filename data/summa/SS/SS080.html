</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the virtues annexed to justice are unsuitably 
enumerated Tully [*De Invent. ii, 53] reckons six, viz. "religion, piety, 
gratitude, revenge, observance, truth." Now revenge is seemingly a 
species of commutative justice whereby revenge is taken for injuries 
inflicted, as stated above (<A Href="SS061.html#SSQ61OUTP1">Question [61]</a>, <A Href="SS061.html#SSQ61A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore it should not be 
reckoned among the virtues annexed to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Macrobius (Super Somn. Scip. i, 8) reckons seven, viz. 
"innocence, friendship, concord, piety, religion, affection, humanity," 
several of which are omitted by Tully. Therefore the virtues annexed to 
justice would seem to be insufficiently enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, others reckon five parts of justice, viz. "obedience" in 
respect of one's superiors, "discipline" with regard to inferiors, 
"equity" as regards equals, "fidelity" and "truthfulness" towards all; 
and of these "truthfulness" alone is mentioned by Tully. Therefore he 
would seem to have enumerated insufficiently the virtues annexed to 
justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the peripatetic Andronicus [*De Affectibus] reckons nine 
parts annexed to justice viz. "liberality, kindliness, revenge, 
commonsense, [*{eugnomosyne}] piety, gratitude, holiness, just exchange" 
and "just lawgiving"; and of all these it is evident that Tully mentions 
none but "revenge." Therefore he would appear to have made an incomplete 
enumeration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Aristotle (Ethic. v, 10) mentions {epieikeia} as being 
annexed to justice: and yet seemingly it is not included in any of the 
foregoing enumerations. Therefore the virtues annexed to justice are 
insufficiently enumerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two points must be observed about the virtues annexed to 
a principal virtue. The first is that these virtues have something in 
common with the principal virtue; and the second is that in some respect 
they fall short of the perfection of that virtue. Accordingly since 
justice is of one man to another as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), all the 
virtues that are directed to another person may by reason of this common 
aspect be annexed to justice. Now the essential character of justice 
consists in rendering to another his due according to equality, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>). Wherefore in two ways may a virtue directed to 
another person fall short of the perfection of justice: first, by falling 
short of the aspect of equality; secondly, by falling short of the aspect 
of due. For certain virtues there are which render another his due, but 
are unable to render the equal due. In the first place, whatever man 
renders to God is due, yet it cannot be equal, as though man rendered to 
God as much as he owes Him, according to Ps. 115:12, "What shall I render 
to the Lord for all the things that He hath rendered to me?" In this 
respect "religion" is annexed  to justice since, according to Tully (De 
invent. ii, 53), it consists in offering service and ceremonial rites or 
worship to "some superior nature that men call divine." Secondly, it is 
not possible to make to one's parents an equal return of what one owes to 
them, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. viii, 14); and thus "piety" is 
annexed to justice, for thereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), a man 
"renders service and constant deference to his kindred and the 
well-wishers of his country." Thirdly, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. iv, 3), man is unable to offer an equal meed for virtue, and thus 
"observance" is annexed to justice, consisting according to Tully (De 
invent. ii, 53) in the "deference and honor rendered to those who excel 
in worth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A falling short of the just due may be considered in respect of a 
twofold due, moral or legal: wherefore the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 13) 
assigns a corresponding twofold just. The legal due is that which one is 
bound to render by reason of a legal obligation; and this due is chiefly 
the concern of justice, which is the principal virtue. On the other hand, 
the moral due is that to which one is bound in respect of the rectitude 
of virtue: and since a due implies necessity, this kind of due has two 
degrees. For one due is so necessary that without it moral rectitude 
cannot be ensured: and this has more of the character of due. Moreover 
this due may be considered from the point of view of the debtor, and in 
this way it pertains to this kind of due that a man represent himself to 
others just as he is, both in word and deed. Wherefore to justice is 
annexed "truth," whereby, as Tully says (De invent. ii, 53), present, 
past and future things are told without perversion. It may also be 
considered from the point of view of the person to whom it is due, by 
comparing the reward he receives with what he has done---sometimes in 
good things; and then annexed to justice we have "gratitude" which 
"consists in recollecting the friendship and kindliness shown by others, 
and in desiring to pay them back," as Tully states (De invent. ii, 
53)---and sometimes in evil things, and then to justice is annexed 
"revenge," whereby, as Tully states (De invent. ii, 53), "we resist 
force, injury or anything obscure* by taking vengeance or by 
self-defense." [*St. Thomas read 'obscurum,' and explains it as meaning 
'derogatory,' infra Question [108], Article [2]. Cicero, however, wrote 'obfuturum,' 
i.e. 'hurtful.']<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; There is another due that is necessary in the sense that it conduces to 
greater rectitude, although without it rectitude may be ensured. This due 
is the concern of "liberality," "affability" or "friendship," or the 
like, all of which Tully omits in the aforesaid enumeration because there 
is little of the nature of anything due in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The revenge taken by authority of a public power, in 
accordance with a judge's sentence, belongs to commutative justice: 
whereas the revenge which a man takes on his own initiative, though not 
against the law, or which a man seeks to obtain from a judge, belongs to 
the virtue annexed to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Macrobius appears to have considered the two  integral 
parts of justice, namely, "declining from evil," to which "innocence" 
belongs, and "doing good," to which the six others belong. Of these, two 
would seem to regard relations between equals, namely, "friendship" in 
the external conduct and "concord" internally; two regard our relations 
toward superiors, namely, "piety" to parents, and "religion" to God; 
while two regard our relations towards inferiors, namely, 
"condescension," in so far as their good pleases us, and "humanity," 
whereby we help them in their needs. For Isidore says (Etym. x) that a 
man is said to be "humane, through having a feeling of love and pity 
towards men: this gives its name to humanity whereby we uphold one 
another." In this sense "friendship" is understood as directing our 
external conduct towards others, from which point of view the Philosopher 
treats of it in Ethic. iv, 6. "Friendship" may also be taken as regarding 
properly the affections, and as the Philosopher describes it in Ethic. 
viii and ix. In this sense three things pertain to friendship, namely, 
"benevolence" which is here called "affection"; "concord," and 
"beneficence" which is here called "humanity." These three, however, are 
omitted by Tully, because, as stated above, they have little of the 
nature of a due.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> "Obedience" is included in observance, which Tully 
mentions, because both reverential honor and obedience are due to persons 
who excel. "Faithfulness whereby a man's acts agree with his words" 
[*Cicero, De Repub. iv, De Offic. i, 7], is contained in "truthfulness" 
as to the observance of one's promises: yet "truthfulness" covers a wider 
ground, as we shall state further on (<A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109OUTP1">Question [109]</a>, <A Href="SS109.html#SSQ109ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). "Discipline" is 
not due as a necessary duty, because one is under no obligation to an 
inferior as such, although a superior may be under an obligation to watch 
over his inferiors, according to Mt. 24:45, "A faithful and wise servant, 
whom his lord hath appointed over his family": and for this reason it is 
omitted by Tully. It may, however, be included in humanity mentioned by 
Macrobius; and equity under {epieikeia} or under "friendship."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This enumeration contains some belonging to true justice. 
To particular justice belongs "justice of exchange," which he describes 
as "the habit of observing equality in commutations." To legal justice, 
as regards things to be observed by all, he ascribes "legislative 
justice," which he describes as "the science of political commutations 
relating to the community." As regards things which have to be done in 
particular cases beside the general laws, he mentions "common sense" or 
"good judgment*," which is our guide in such like matters, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) in the treatise on prudence: wherefore he says that 
it is a "voluntary justification," because by his own free will man 
observes what is just according to his judgment and not according to the 
written law. [*St. Thomas indicates the Greek derivation: {eugnomosyne} 
quasi 'bona {gnome}.'] These two are ascribed to prudence as their 
director, and to justice as their executor. {Eusebeia} [piety] means 
"good worship" and consequently is the same as religion, wherefore he 
says that it is the science of "the service of God" (he speaks after the 
manner of Socrates who said that 'all the virtues are sciences') 
[*Aristotle, Ethic. vi, 13]: and "holiness"  comes to the same, as we 
shall state further on (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). {Eucharistia} (gratitude) means 
"good thanksgiving," and is mentioned by Macrobius: wherefore Isidore 
says (Etym. x) that "a kind man is one who is ready of his own accord to 
do good, and is of gentle speech": and Andronicus too says that 
"kindliness is a habit of voluntary beneficence." "Liberality" would seem 
to pertain to "humanity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[80] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> {Epieikeia} is annexed, not to particular but to legal 
justice, and apparently is the same as that which goes by the name of 
{eugnomosyne} [common sense].<br>
