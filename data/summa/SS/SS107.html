<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that ingratitude is not always a sin. For Seneca says 
(De Benef. iii) that "he who does not repay a favor is ungrateful." But 
sometimes it is impossible to repay a favor without sinning, for instance 
if one man has helped another to commit a sin. Therefore, since it is not 
a sin to refrain from sinning, it seems that ingratitude is not always a 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every sin is in the power of the person who commits it: 
because, according to Augustine (De Lib. Arb. iii; Retract. i), "no man 
sins in what he cannot avoid." Now sometimes it is not in the power of 
the sinner to avoid ingratitude, for instance when he has not the means 
of repaying. Again forgetfulness is not in our power, and yet Seneca 
declares (De Benef. iii) that "to forget a kindness is the height of 
ingratitude." Therefore ingratitude is not always a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there would seem to be no repayment in being unwilling 
to owe anything, according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++13:8">Rm. 13:8</a>), "Owe no man 
anything." Yet "an unwilling debtor is ungrateful," as Seneca declares 
(De Benef. iv). Therefore ingratitude is not always a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ingratitude is reckoned among other sins (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Tim++3:2">2 Tim. 3:2</a>), 
where it is written: "Disobedient to parents, ungrateful, wicked." etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A4A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>) a debt of 
gratitude is a moral debt required by virtue. Now a thing is a sin from 
the fact of its being contrary to virtue. Wherefore it is evident that 
every ingratitude is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Gratitude regards a favor received: and he that helps 
another to commit a sin does him not a favor but an injury: and so no 
thanks are due to him, except perhaps on account of his good will, 
supposing him to have been deceived, and to have thought to help him in 
doing good, whereas he helped him to sin. In such a case the repayment 
due to him is not that he should be helped to commit a sin, because this 
would be repaying not good but evil, and this is contrary to gratitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No man is excused from ingratitude through inability to 
repay, for the very reason that the mere will suffices for the repayment 
of the debt of gratitude, as stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forgetfulness of a favor received amounts to ingratitude, not indeed the 
forgetfulness that arises from a natural defect, that is not subject to 
the will, but that which arises from negligence. For, as Seneca observes 
(De Benef. iii), "when forgetfulness of favors lays hold of a man, he has 
apparently given little thought to their repayment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The debt of gratitude flows from the debt of love, and from 
the latter no man should wish to be free. Hence that anyone should owe 
this debt unwillingly seems to arise from lack of love for his benefactor.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether ingratitude is a special sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that ingratitude is not a special sin. For whoever sins 
acts against God his sovereign benefactor. But this pertains to 
ingratitude. Therefore ingratitude is not a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no special sin is contained under different kinds of 
sin. But one can be ungrateful by committing different kinds of sin, for 
instance by calumny, theft, or something similar committed against a 
benefactor. Therefore ingratitude is not a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Seneca writes (De Benef. iii): "It is ungrateful to take 
no notice of a kindness, it is ungrateful not to repay one, but it is the 
height of ingratitude to forget it." Now these do not seem to belong to 
the same species of sin. Therefore ingratitude is not a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ingratitude is opposed to gratitude or thankfulness, 
which is a special virtue. Therefore it is a special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every vice is denominated from a deficiency of virtue, 
because deficiency is more opposed to virtue: thus illiberality is more 
opposed to liberality than prodigality is. Now a vice may be opposed to 
the virtue of gratitude by way of excess, for instance if one were to 
show gratitude for things for which gratitude is not due, or sooner than 
it is due, as stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But still more opposed to 
gratitude is the vice denoting deficiency of gratitude, because the 
virtue of gratitude, as stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), inclines to return 
something more. Wherefore ingratitude is properly denominated from being 
a deficiency of gratitude. Now every deficiency or privation takes its 
species from the opposite habit: for blindness and deafness differ 
according to the difference of sight and hearing. Therefore just as 
gratitude or thankfulness is one special virtue, so also is ingratitude 
one special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It has, however, various degrees corresponding in their order to the 
things required for gratitude. The first of these is to recognize the 
favor received, the second to express one's appreciation and thanks, and 
the third to repay the favor at a suitable place and time according to 
one's means. And since what is last in the order of generation is first 
in the order of destruction, it follows that the first degree of 
ingratitude is when a man fails to repay a favor, the second when he 
declines to notice or indicate that he has received a favor, while the 
third  and supreme degree is when a man fails to recognize the reception 
of a favor, whether by forgetting it or in any other way. Moreover, since 
opposite affirmation includes negation, it follows that it belongs to the 
first degree of ingratitude to return evil for good, to the second to 
find fault with a favor received, and to the third to esteem kindness as 
though it were unkindness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In every sin there is material ingratitude to God, inasmuch 
as a man does something that may pertain to ingratitude. But formal 
ingratitude is when a favor is actually contemned, and this is a special 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Nothing hinders the formal aspect of some special sin from 
being found materially in several kinds of sin, and in this way the 
aspect of ingratitude is to be found in many kinds of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These three are not different species but different degrees 
of one special sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether ingratitude is always a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that ingratitude is always a mortal sin. For one ought 
to be grateful to God above all. But one is not ungrateful to God by 
committing a venial sin: else every man would be guilty of ingratitude. 
Therefore no ingratitude is a venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a sin is mortal through being contrary to charity, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24OUTP1">Question [24]</a>, <A Href="SS024.html#SSQ24A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>). But ingratitude is contrary to charity, 
since the debt of gratitude proceeds from that virtue, as stated above 
(<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A1A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2). Therefore ingratitude is always a 
mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Seneca says (De Benef. ii): "Between the giver and the 
receiver of a favor there is this law, that the former should forthwith 
forget having given, and the latter should never forget having received." 
Now, seemingly, the reason why the giver should forget is that he may be 
unaware of the sin of the recipient, should the latter prove ungrateful; 
and there would be no necessity for that if ingratitude were a slight 
sin. Therefore ingratitude is always a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, No one should be put in the way of committing a 
mortal sin. Yet, according to Seneca (De Benef. ii), "sometimes it is 
necessary to deceive the person who receives assistance, in order that he 
may receive without knowing from whom he has received." But this would 
seem to put the recipient in the way of ingratitude. Therefore 
ingratitude is not always a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what we have said above (<A Href="SS107.html#SSQ107A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a man may 
be ungrateful in two ways: first, by mere omission, for instance by 
failing to recognize the favor received, or to express  his appreciation 
of it or to pay something in return, and this is not always a mortal sin, 
because, as stated above (<A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106OUTP1">Question [106]</a>, <A Href="SS106.html#SSQ106A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), the debt of gratitude requires a 
man to make a liberal return, which, however, he is not bound to do; 
wherefore if he fail to do so, he does not sin mortally. It is 
nevertheless a venial sin, because it arises either from some kind of 
negligence or from some disinclination to virtue in him. And yet 
ingratitude of this kind may happen to be a mortal sin, by reason either 
of inward contempt, or of the kind of thing withheld, this being needful 
to the benefactor, either simply, or in some case of necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a man may be ungrateful, because he not only omits to pay the 
debt of gratitude, but does the contrary. This again is sometimes mortal 
and sometimes a venial sin, according to the kind of thing that is done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be observed, however, that when ingratitude arises from a mortal 
sin, it has the perfect character of ingratitude, and when it arises from 
venial sin, it has the imperfect character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By committing a venial sin one is not ungrateful to God to 
the extent of incurring the guilt of perfect ingratitude: but there is 
something of ingratitude in a venial sin, in so far as it removes a 
virtuous act of obedience to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When ingratitude is a venial sin it is not contrary to, but 
beside charity: since it does not destroy the habit of charity, but 
excludes some act thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Seneca also says (De Benef. vii): "When we say that a man 
after conferring a favor should forget about it, it is a mistake to 
suppose that we mean him to shake off the recollection of a thing so very 
praiseworthy. When we say: He must not remember it, we mean that he must 
not publish it abroad and boast about it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> He that is unaware of a favor conferred on him is not 
ungrateful, if he fails to repay it, provided he be prepared to do so if 
he knew. It is nevertheless commendable at times that the object of a 
favor should remain in ignorance of it, both in order to avoid vainglory, 
as when Blessed Nicolas threw gold into a house secretly, wishing to 
avoid popularity: and because the kindness is all the greater through the 
benefactor wishing not to shame the person on whom he is conferring the 
favor.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether favors should be withheld from the ungrateful?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that favors should withheld from the ungrateful. For it 
is written (Wis. 16:29): "The hope of the unthankful shall melt away as 
the winter's ice." But this hope would not melt away unless favors were 
withheld from him. Therefore favors should be withheld from the 
ungrateful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one should afford another an occasion of  committing 
sin. But the ungrateful in receiving a favor is given an occasion of 
ingratitude. Therefore favors should not be bestowed on the ungrateful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "By what things a man sinneth, by the same also he is 
tormented" (Wis. 11:17). Now he that is ungrateful when he receives a 
favor sins against the favor. Therefore he should be deprived of the 
favor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++6:35">Lk. 6:35</a>) that "the Highest . . . is 
kind to the unthankful, and to the evil." Now we should prove ourselves 
His children by imitating Him (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++6:36">Lk. 6:36</a>). Therefore we should not 
withhold favors from the ungrateful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two points to be considered with regard to an 
ungrateful person. The first is what he deserves to suffer and thus it is 
certain that he deserves to be deprived of our favor. The second is, what 
ought his benefactor to do? For in the first place he should not easily 
judge him to be ungrateful, since, as Seneca remarks (De Benef. iii), "a 
man is often grateful although he repays not," because perhaps he has not 
the means or the opportunity of repaying. Secondly, he should be inclined 
to turn his ungratefulness into gratitude, and if he does not achieve 
this by being kind to him once, he may by being so a second time. If, 
however, the more he repeats his favors, the more ungrateful and evil the 
other becomes, he should cease from bestowing his favors upon him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passage quoted speaks of what the ungrateful man 
deserves to suffer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> He that bestows a favor on an ungrateful person affords him 
an occasion not of sin but of gratitude and love. And if the recipient 
takes therefrom an occasion of ingratitude, this is not to be imputed to 
the bestower.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[107] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that bestows a favor must not at once act the part of a 
punisher of ingratitude, but rather that of a kindly physician, by 
healing the ingratitude with repeated favors.<br>
