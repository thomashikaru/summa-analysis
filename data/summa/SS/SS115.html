<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vices opposed to the aforesaid virtue: (1) 
Flattery, and (2) Quarreling. Concerning flattery there are two points of 
inquiry:<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that flattery is not a sin. For flattery consists in 
words of praise offered to another in order to please him. But it is not 
a sin to praise a person, according to Prov. 31:28, "Her children rose up 
and called her blessed: her husband, and he praised her." Moreover, there 
is no evil in wishing to please others, according to 1 Cor. 10:33, "I . . 
. in all things please all men." Therefore flattery is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, evil is contrary to good, and blame to praise. But it is 
not a sin to blame evil. Neither, then, is it a sin to praise good, which 
seems to belong to flattery. Therefore flattery is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, detraction is contrary to flattery. Wherefore Gregory 
says (Moral. xxii, 5) that detraction is a remedy against flattery. "It 
must be observed," says he, "that by the wonderful moderation of our 
Ruler, we are often allowed to be rent by detractions but are uplifted by 
immoderate praise, so that whom the voice of the flatterer upraises, the 
tongue of the detractor may humble." But detraction is an evil, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="SS073.html#SSQ73ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3). Therefore flattery is a good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Ezech. 13:18, "Woe to them that sew cushions 
under every elbow," says, "that is to say, sweet flattery." Therefore 
flattery is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS114.html#SSQ114OUTP1">Question [114]</a>, <A Href="SS114.html#SSQ114A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), although the 
friendship of which we have been speaking, or affability, intends chiefly 
the pleasure of those among whom one lives, yet it does not fear to 
displease when it is a question of obtaining a certain good, or of 
avoiding a certain evil. Accordingly, if a man were to wish always to 
speak pleasantly to others, he would exceed the mode of pleasing, and 
would therefore sin by excess. If he do this with the mere intention of 
pleasing he is said to be "complaisant," according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. iv, 6): whereas if he do it with the intention of making some 
gain out of it, he is called a "flatterer" or "adulator." As a rule, 
however, the term "flattery" is wont to be applied to all who wish to 
exceed the mode of virtue in pleasing others by words or deeds in their 
ordinary behavior towards their fellows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> One may praise a person both well and ill, according as one 
observes or omits the due circumstances. For if while observing other due 
circumstances one were to wish to please a person by praising him, in 
order thereby to console him, or that he may strive to make progress in 
good, this will belong to the aforesaid virtue of friendship. But it 
would belong to flattery, if one wished to praise a person for things in 
which he ought not to be praised; since perhaps they are evil, according 
to Ps. 9:24, "The sinner is praised in the desires of his soul"; or they 
may be uncertain, according to Ecclus. 27:8, "Praise not a man before he 
speaketh," and again (Ecclus. 11:2), "Praise not a man for his beauty"; 
or because there may be fear lest human praise should  incite him to 
vainglory, wherefore it is written, (Ecclus. 11:30), "Praise not any man 
before death." Again, in like manner it is right to wish to please a man 
in order to foster charity, so that he may make spiritual progress 
therein. But it would be sinful to wish to please men for the sake of 
vainglory or gain, or to please them in something evil, according to Ps. 
52:6, "God hath scattered the bones of them that please men," and 
according to the words of the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++1:10">Gal. 1:10</a>), "If I yet pleased men, 
I should not be the servant of Christ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even to blame evil is sinful, if due circumstances be not 
observed; and so too is it to praise good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing hinders two vices being contrary to one another. 
Wherefore even as detraction is evil, so is flattery, which is contrary 
thereto as regards what is said, but not directly as regards the end. 
Because flattery seeks to please the person flattered, whereas the 
detractor seeks not the displeasure of the person defamed, since at times 
he defames him in secret, but seeks rather his defamation.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether flattery is a mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that flattery is a mortal sin. For, according to 
Augustine (Enchiridion xii), "a thing is evil because it is harmful." But 
flattery is most harmful, according to Ps. 9:24, "For the sinner is 
praised in the desires of his soul, and the unjust man is blessed. The 
sinner hath provoked the Lord." Wherefore Jerome says (Ep. ad Celant): 
"Nothing so easily corrupts the human mind as flattery": and a gloss on 
Ps. 69:4, "Let them be presently turned away blushing for shame that say 
to me: 'Tis well, 'Tis well," says: "The tongue of the flatterer harms 
more than the sword of the persecutor." Therefore flattery is a most 
grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever does harm by words, harms himself no less than 
others: wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++36:15">Ps. 36:15</a>): "Let their sword enter into 
their own hearts." Now he that flatters another induces him to sin 
mortally: hence a gloss on Ps. 140:5, "Let not the oil of the sinner 
fatten my head," says: "The false praise of the flatterer softens the 
mind by depriving it of the rigidity of truth and renders it susceptive 
of vice." Much more, therefore, does the flatterer sin in himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written in the Decretals (D. XLVI, Cap. 3): "The 
cleric who shall be found to spend his time in flattery and treachery 
shall be degraded from his office." Now such a punishment as this is not 
inflicted save for mortal sin. Therefore flattery is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine in a sermon on Purgatory (xli, de Sanctis) 
reckons among slight sins, "if one desire to flatter any person of higher 
standing, whether of one's own choice, or out of necessity." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS112.html#SSQ112OUTP1">Question [112]</a>, <A Href="SS112.html#SSQ112A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), a mortal sin is one that 
is contrary to charity. Now flattery is sometimes contrary to charity and 
sometimes not. It is contrary to charity in three ways. First, by reason 
of the very matter, as when one man praises another's sin: for this is 
contrary to the love of God, against Whose justice he speaks, and 
contrary to the love of his neighbor, whom he encourages to sin. 
Wherefore this is a mortal sin, according to Is. 5:20. "Woe to you that 
call evil good." Secondly, by reason of the intention, as when one man 
flatters another, so that by deceiving him he may injure him in body or 
in soul; this is also a mortal sin, and of this it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++27:6">Prov. 27:6</a>): "Better are the wounds of a friend than the deceitful kisses of an 
enemy." Thirdly, by way of occasion, as when the praise of a flatterer, 
even without his intending it, becomes to another an occasion of sin. In 
this case it is necessary to consider, whether the occasion were given or 
taken, and how grievous the consequent downfall, as may be understood 
from what has been said above concerning scandal (<A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>, <A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). If, 
however, one man flatters another from the mere craving to please others, 
or again in order to avoid some evil, or to acquire something in a case 
of necessity, this is not contrary to charity. Consequently it is not a 
mortal but a venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The passages quoted speak of the flatterer who praises 
another's sin. Flattery of this kind is said to harm more than the sword 
of the persecutor, since it does harm to goods that are of greater 
consequence. namely, spiritual goods. Yet it does not harm so 
efficaciously, since the sword of the persecutor slays effectively, being 
a sufficient cause of death; whereas no one by flattering can be a 
sufficient cause of another's sinning, as was shown above (<A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>, <A Href="SS043.html#SSQ43A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 3; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS080.html#FSQ80OUTP1">Question [80]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS080.html#FSQ80A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument applies to one that flatters with the 
intention of doing harm: for such a man harms himself more than others, 
since he harms himself, as the sufficient cause of sinning, whereas he is 
only the occasional cause of the harm he does to others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[115] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The passage quoted refers to the man who flatters another 
treacherously, in order to deceive him.<br>
