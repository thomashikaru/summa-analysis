<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the acts of religion. First, we shall consider the 
interior acts, which, as stated above, are its principal acts; secondly, 
we shall consider its exterior acts, which are secondary. The interior 
acts of religion are seemingly devotion and prayer. Accordingly we shall 
treat first of devotion, and afterwards of prayer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] Out. Para. 2/2-->

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that devotion is not a special act. That which 
qualifies other acts is seemingly not a special act. Now devotion seems 
to qualify other acts, for it is written (2 Paralip 29:31): "All the 
multitude offered victims, and praises, and holocausts with a devout 
mind." Therefore devotion is not a special act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no special kind of act is common to various genera of 
acts. But devotion is common to various genera of acts, namely, corporal 
and spiritual acts: for a person is said to meditate devoutly and to 
genuflect devoutly. Therefore devotion is not a special act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every special act belongs either to an appetitive or to 
a cognitive virtue or power. But devotion belongs to neither, as may be 
seen by going through the various species of acts of either faculty, as 
enumerated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP000.html#FPQOUTP1">Questions [78]</a>, seqq.; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore devotion 
is not a special act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Merits are acquired by acts as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS021.html#FSQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS021.html#FSQ21ATHEP1">Articles [34]</a>). But devotion has a special reason for merit. Therefore devotion 
is a special act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Devotion is derived from "devote" [*The Latin 'devovere' 
means 'to vow']; wherefore those persons are said to be "devout" who, in 
a way, devote themselves to God, so as to subject themselves wholly to 
Him. Hence in olden times among the heathens a devotee was one who vowed 
to his idols to suffer death for the safety of his army, as Livy relates 
of the two Decii (Decad. I, viii, 9; x, 28). Hence devotion is apparently 
nothing else but the will to give oneself readily to things concerning 
the service of God. Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++35:20,21">Ex. 35:20,21</a>) that "the 
multitude of the children of Israel . . . offered first-fruits to the 
Lord with a most ready and devout mind." Now it is evident that the will 
to do readily what concerns the service of God is a special kind of  act. 
Therefore devotion is a special act of the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The mover prescribes the mode of the movement of the thing 
moved. Now the will moves the other powers of the soul to their acts, and 
the will, in so far as it regards the end, moves both itself and whatever 
is directed to the end, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9OUTP1">Question [9]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS009.html#FSQ9A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore, 
since devotion is an act of the will whereby a man offers himself for the 
service of God Who is the last end, it follows that devotion prescribes 
the mode to human acts, whether they be acts of the will itself about 
things directed to the end, or acts of the other powers that are moved by 
the will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Devotion is to be found in various genera of acts, not as a 
species of those genera, but as the motion of the mover is found 
virtually in the movements of the things moved.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Devotion is an act of the appetitive part of the soul, and 
is a movement of the will, as stated above.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that devotion is not an act of religion. Devotion, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), consists in giving oneself up to God. But this is 
done chiefly by charity, since according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) "the 
Divine love produces ecstasy, for it takes the lover away from himself 
and gives him to the beloved." Therefore devotion is an act of charity 
rather than of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, charity precedes religion; and devotion seems to precede 
charity; since, in the Scriptures, charity is represented by fire, while 
devotion is signified by fatness which is the material of fire [*Cant. 
8:6; Ps. 52:6]. Therefore devotion is not an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by religion man is directed to God alone, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But devotion is directed also to men; for we speak 
of people being devout to certain holy men, and subjects are said to be 
devoted to their masters; thus Pope Leo says [*Serm. viii, De Pass. Dom.] 
that the Jews "out of devotion to the Roman laws," said: "We have no king 
but Caesar." Therefore devotion is not an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Devotion is derived from "devovere," as stated (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
But a vow is an act of religion. Therefore devotion is also an act of 
religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It belongs to the same virtue, to will to do something, 
and to have the will ready to do it, because both acts have the same 
object. For this reason the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 1): "It is 
justice whereby men both will end do just actions." Now it is evident 
that to do what pertains to the worship or service of God, belongs 
properly to religion, as stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>). Wherefore it belongs to 
that virtue to have the will ready  to do such things, and this is to be 
devout. Hence it is evident that devotion is an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs immediately to charity that man should give 
himself to God, adhering to Him by a union of the spirit; but it belongs 
immediately to religion, and, through the medium of religion, to charity 
which is the principle of religion, that man should give himself to God 
for certain works of Divine worship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Bodily fatness is produced by the natural heat in the 
process of digestion, and at the same time the natural heat thrives, as 
it were, on this fatness. In like manner charity both causes devotion 
(inasmuch as love makes one ready to serve one's friend) and feeds on 
devotion. Even so all friendship is safeguarded and increased by the 
practice and consideration of friendly deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Devotion to God's holy ones, dead or living, does not 
terminate in them, but passes on to God, in so far as we honor God in His 
servants. But the devotion of subjects to their temporal masters is of 
another kind, just as service of a temporal master differs from the 
service of God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether contemplation or meditation is the cause of devotion?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contemplation or meditation is not the cause 
of devotion. No cause hinders its effect. But subtle considerations about 
abstract matters are often a hindrance to devotion. Therefore 
contemplation or meditation is not the cause of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if contemplation were the proper and essential cause of 
devotion, the higher objects of contemplation would arouse greater 
devotion. But the contrary is the case: since frequently we are urged to 
greater devotion by considering Christ's Passion and other mysteries of 
His humanity than by considering the greatness of His Godhead. Therefore 
contemplation is not the proper cause of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if contemplation were the proper cause of devotion, it 
would follow that those who are most apt for contemplation, are also most 
apt for devotion. Yet the contrary is to be noticed, for devotion is 
frequently found in men of simplicity and members of the female sex, who 
are defective in contemplation. Therefore contemplation is not the proper 
cause of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++38:4">Ps. 38:4</a>): "In my meditation a fire 
shall flame out." But spiritual fire causes devotion. Therefore 
meditation is the cause of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The extrinsic and chief cause of devotion is God, of Whom 
Ambrose, commenting on Lk. 9:55, says that "God calls  whom He deigns to 
call, and whom He wills He makes religious: the profane Samaritans, had 
He so willed, He would have made devout." But the intrinsic cause on our 
part must needs be meditation or contemplation. For it was stated above 
(<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) that devotion is an act of the will to the effect that man 
surrenders himself readily to the service of God. Now every act of the 
will proceeds from some consideration, since the object of the will is a 
good understood. Wherefore Augustine says (De Trin. ix, 12; xv, 23) that 
"the will arises from the intelligence." Consequently meditation must 
needs be the cause of devotion, in so far as through meditation man 
conceives the thought of surrendering himself to God's service. Indeed a 
twofold consideration leads him thereto. The one is the consideration of 
God's goodness and loving kindness, according to Ps. 72:28, "It is good 
for me to adhere to my God, to put my hope in the Lord God": and this 
consideration wakens love [*'Dilectio,' the interior act of charity; cf. 
Question [27]] which is the proximate cause of devotion. The other consideration 
is that of man's own shortcomings, on account of which he needs to lean 
on God, according to Ps. 120:1,2, "I have lifted up my eyes to the 
mountains, from whence help shall come to me: my help is from the Lord, 
Who made heaven and earth"; and this consideration shuts out presumption 
whereby man is hindered from submitting to God, because he leans on His 
strength.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The consideration of such things as are of a nature to 
awaken our love [*'Dilectio,' the interior act of charity; cf. Question [27]] of 
God, causes devotion; whereas the consideration of foreign matters that 
distract the mind from such things is a hindrance to devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Matters concerning the Godhead are, in themselves, the 
strongest incentive to love ['dilectio,' the interior act of charity; cf. 
Question [27]] and consequently to devotion, because God is supremely lovable. 
Yet such is the weakness of the human mind that it needs a guiding hand, 
not only to the knowledge, but also to the love of Divine things by means 
of certain sensible objects known to us. Chief among these is the 
humanity of Christ, according to the words of the Preface [*Preface for 
Christmastide], "that through knowing God visibly, we may be caught up to 
the love of things invisible." Wherefore matters relating to Christ's 
humanity are the chief incentive to devotion, leading us thither as a 
guiding hand, although devotion itself has for its object matters 
concerning the Godhead.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Science and anything else conducive to greatness, is to man 
an occasion of self-confidence, so that he does not wholly surrender 
himself to God. The result is that such like things sometimes occasion a 
hindrance to devotion; while in simple souls and women devotion abounds 
by repressing pride. If, however, a man perfectly submits to God his 
science or any other perfection, by this very fact his devotion is 
increased.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether joy is an effect of devotion? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that joy is not an effect of devotion. As stated 
above (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), Christ's Passion is the chief incentive to devotion. 
But the consideration thereof causes an affliction of the soul, according 
to Lam. 3:19, "Remember my poverty . . . the wormwood and the gall," 
which refers to the Passion, and afterwards (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lam++3:20">Lam. 3:20</a>) it is said: "I 
will be mindful and remember, and my soul shall languish within me." 
Therefore delight or joy is not the effect of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, devotion consists chiefly in an interior sacrifice of 
the spirit. But it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++50:19">Ps. 50:19</a>): "A sacrifice to God is an 
afflicted spirit." Therefore affliction is the effect of devotion rather 
than gladness or joy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory of Nyssa says (De Homine xii) [*Orat. funebr. de 
Placilla Imp.] that "just as laughter proceeds from joy, so tears and 
groans are signs of sorrow." But devotion makes some people shed tears. 
Therefore gladness or joy is not the effect of devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> We say in the Collect [*Thursday after fourth Sunday of 
Lent]: "That we who are punished by fasting may be comforted by a holy 
devotion."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The direct and principal effect of devotion is the 
spiritual joy of the mind, though sorrow is its secondary and indirect 
effect. For it has been stated (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that devotion is caused by a 
twofold consideration: chiefly by the consideration of God's goodness, 
because this consideration belongs to the term, as it were, of the 
movement of the will in surrendering itself to God, and the direct result 
of this consideration is joy, according to Ps. 76:4, "I remembered God, 
and was delighted"; but accidentally this consideration causes a certain 
sorrow in those who do not yet enjoy God fully, according to Ps. 41:3, 
"My soul hath thirsted after the strong living God," and afterwards it is 
said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++41:4">Ps. 41:4</a>): "My tears have been my bread," etc. Secondarily devotion 
is caused as stated (<A Href="SS082.html#SSQ82A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), by the consideration of one's own failings; 
for this consideration regards the term from which man withdraws by the 
movement of his devout will, in that he trusts not in himself, but 
subjects himself to God. This consideration has an opposite tendency to 
the first: for it is of a nature to cause sorrow directly (when one 
thinks over one's own failings), and joy accidentally, namely, through 
hope of the Divine assistance. It is accordingly evident that the first 
and direct effect of devotion is joy, while the secondary and accidental 
effect is that "sorrow which is according to God" [*2 Cor. 7:10].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the consideration of Christ's Passion there is something 
that causes sorrow, namely, the human defect, the removal of which made 
it necessary for Christ to suffer [*Lk. 24:25]; and there is something 
that causes joy, namely, God's loving-kindness to us in giving us such a 
deliverance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The spirit which on the one hand is afflicted on account of 
the defects of the present life, on the other hand is rejoiced, by the 
consideration of God's goodness, and by the hope of the Divine help.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[82] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Tears are caused not only through sorrow, but also through 
a certain tenderness of the affections, especially when one considers 
something that gives joy mixed with pain. Thus men are wont to shed tears 
through a sentiment of piety, when they recover their children or dear 
friends, whom they thought to have lost. In this way tears arise from 
devotion.<br>
