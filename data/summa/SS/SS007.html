</h3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the effects of faith: under which head there are 
two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ7A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether fear is an effect of faith?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ7A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the heart is purified by faith?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that fear is not an effect of faith. For an effect 
does not precede its cause. Now fear precedes faith: for it is written 
(Ecclus. 2:8): "Ye that fear the Lord, believe in Him." Therefore fear is 
not an effect of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same thing is not the cause of contraries. Now fear 
and hope are contraries, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>): and faith 
begets hope, as a gloss observes on Mt. 1:2. Therefore fear is not an 
effect of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one contrary does not cause another. Now the object of 
faith is a good, which is the First Truth, while the object of fear is an 
evil, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42OUTP1">Question [42]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS042.html#FSQ42A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Again, acts take their species 
from the object, according to what was stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore faith is not a cause of fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?James+2:19">James 2:19</a>): "The devils . .  . believe 
and tremble."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Fear is a movement of the appetitive power, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS041.html#FSQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the principle of all appetitive movements is 
the good or evil apprehended: and consequently the principle of fear and 
of every appetitive movement must be an apprehension. Again, through 
faith there arises in us an apprehension of certain penal evils, which 
are inflicted in accordance with the Divine judgment. In this way, then, 
faith is a cause of the fear whereby one dreads to be punished by God; 
and this is servile fear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is also the cause of filial fear, whereby one dreads to be separated 
from God, or whereby one shrinks from equalling oneself to Him, and holds 
Him in reverence, inasmuch as faith makes us appreciate God as an 
unfathomable and supreme good, separation from which is the greatest 
evil, and to which it is wicked to wish to be equalled. Of the first 
fear, viz. servile fear, lifeless faith is the cause, while living faith 
is the cause of the second, viz. filial fear, because it makes man adhere 
to God and to be subject to Him by charity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fear of God cannot altogether precede faith, because if we 
knew nothing at all about Him, with regard to rewards and punishments, 
concerning which faith teaches us, we should nowise fear Him. If, 
however, faith be presupposed in reference to certain articles of faith, 
for example the Divine excellence, then reverential fear follows, the 
result of which is that man submits his intellect to God, so as to 
believe in all the Divine promises. Hence the text quoted continues: "And 
your reward shall not be made void."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same thing in respect of contraries can be the cause of 
contraries, but not under the same aspect. Now faith begets hope, in so 
far as it enables us to appreciate the prize which God awards to the 
just, while it is the cause of fear, in so far as it makes us appreciate 
the punishments which He intends to inflict on sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The primary and formal object of faith is the good which is 
the First Truth; but the material object of faith includes also certain 
evils; for instance, that it is an evil either not to submit to God, or 
to be separated from Him, and that sinners will suffer penal evils from 
God: in this way faith can be the cause of fear.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether faith has the effect of purifying the heart?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith does not purify the heart. For purity of 
the heart pertains chiefly to the affections, whereas faith is in the 
intellect. Therefore faith has not the effect of purifying the heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which purifies the heart is incompatible with 
impurity. But faith is compatible with the impurity of sin, as may be 
seen in those who have lifeless faith. Therefore faith does not purify 
the heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if faith were to purify the human heart in any way, it 
would chiefly purify the intellect of man. Now it does not purify the 
intellect from obscurity, since it is a veiled knowledge. Therefore faith 
nowise purifies the heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Peter said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+15:9">Acts 15:9</a>): "Purifying their hearts by 
faith."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is impure through being mixed with baser things: 
for silver is not called impure, when mixed with gold, which betters it, 
but when mixed with lead or tin. Now it is evident that the rational 
creature is more excellent than all transient and corporeal creatures; so 
that it becomes impure through subjecting itself to transient things by 
loving them. From this impurity the rational creature is purified by 
means of a contrary movement, namely, by tending to that which is above 
it, viz. God. The first beginning of this movement is faith: since "he 
that cometh to God must believe that He is," according to Heb. 11:6. 
Hence the first beginning of the heart's purifying is faith; and if this 
be perfected through being quickened by charity, the heart will be 
perfectly purified thereby.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Things that are in the intellect are the principles of 
those which are in the appetite, in so far as the apprehended good moves 
the appetite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even lifeless faith excludes a certain impurity which is 
contrary to it, viz. that of error, and which consists in the human 
intellect, adhering inordinately to things below itself, through wishing 
to measure Divine things by the rule of sensible objects. But when it is 
quickened by charity, then it is incompatible with any kind of impurity, 
because "charity covereth all sins" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++10:12">Prov. 10:12</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[7] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The obscurity of faith does not pertain to the impurity of 
sin, but rather to the natural defect of the human intellect, according 
to the present state of life.<br>
