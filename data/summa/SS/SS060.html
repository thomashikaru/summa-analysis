<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judgment is not an act of justice. The 
Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 3) that "everyone judges well of what he 
knows," so that judgment would seem to belong to the cognitive faculty. 
Now the cognitive faculty is perfected by prudence. Therefore judgment 
belongs to prudence rather than to justice, which is in the will, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++2:15">1 Cor. 2:15</a>): "The spiritual man 
judgeth all things." Now man is made spiritual chiefly by the virtue of 
charity, which "is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost Who is 
given to us" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:5">Rm. 5:5</a>). Therefore judgment belongs to charity rather than 
to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs to every virtue to judge aright of its proper 
matter, because "the virtuous man is the rule and measure in everything," 
according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 4). Therefore judgment does not 
belong to justice any more than to the other moral virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, judgment would seem to belong only to judges. But the 
act of justice is to be found in every just man. Since then judges are 
not the only just men, it seems that judgment is not the proper act of 
justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++93:15">Ps. 93:15</a>): "Until justice be turned 
into judgment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment properly denotes the act of a judge as such. Now 
a judge [judex] is so called because he asserts the right [jus dicens] 
and right is the object of justice, as stated above (<A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Consequently the original meaning of the word "judgment" is a statement 
or decision of the just or right. Now to decide  rightly about virtuous 
deeds proceeds, properly speaking, from the virtuous habit; thus a chaste 
person decides rightly about matters relating to chastity. Therefore 
judgment, which denotes a right decision about what is just, belongs 
properly to justice. For this reason the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 4) 
that "men have recourse to a judge as to one who is the personification 
of justice."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The word "judgment," from its original meaning of a right 
decision about what is just, has been extended to signify a right 
decision in any matter whether speculative or practical. Now a right 
judgment in any matter requires two things. The first is the virtue 
itself that pronounces judgment: and in this way, judgment is an act of 
reason, because it belongs to the reason to pronounce or define. The 
other is the disposition of the one who judges, on which depends his 
aptness for judging aright. In this way, in matters of justice, judgment 
proceeds from justice, even as in matters of fortitude, it proceeds from 
fortitude. Accordingly judgment is an act of justice in so far as justice 
inclines one to judge aright, and of prudence in so far as prudence 
pronounces judgment: wherefore {synesis} (judging well according to 
common law) which belongs to prudence is said to "judge rightly," as 
stated above (<A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51OUTP1">Question [51]</a>, <A Href="SS051.html#SSQ51A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The spiritual man, by reason of the habit of charity, has 
an inclination to judge aright of all things according to the Divine 
rules; and it is in conformity with these that he pronounces judgment 
through the gift of wisdom: even as the just man pronounces judgment 
through the virtue of prudence conformably with the ruling of the law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The other virtues regulate man in himself, whereas justice 
regulates man in his dealings with others, as shown above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Now man is master in things concerning himself, but not in matters 
relating to others. Consequently where the other virtues are in question, 
there is no need for judgment other than that of a virtuous man, taking 
judgment in its broader sense, as explained above (ad 1). But in matters 
of justice, there is further need for the judgment of a superior, who is 
"able to reprove both, and to put his hand between both" [*Job 9:33]. 
Hence judgment belongs more specifically to justice than to any other 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Justice is in the sovereign as a master-virtue [*Cf. Question [58], 
Article [6]], commanding and prescribing what is just; while it is in the 
subjects as an executive and administrative virtue. Hence judgment, which 
denotes a decision of what is just, belongs to justice, considered as 
existing chiefly in one who has authority.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful to judge. For nothing is punished except 
what is unlawful. Now those who judge are threatened with punishment, 
which those who judge not will escape, according to Mt. 7:1, "Judge not, 
and ye shall not be judged."  Therefore it is unlawful to judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++14:4">Rm. 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest 
another man's servant. To his own lord he standeth or falleth." Now God 
is the Lord of all. Therefore to no man is it lawful to judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man is sinless, according to 1 Jn. 1:8, "If we say 
that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves." Now it is unlawful for a 
sinner to judge, according to Rm. 2:1, "Thou art inexcusable, O man, 
whosoever thou art, that judgest; for wherein thou judgest another, thou 
condemnest thyself, for thou dost the same things which thou judgest." 
Therefore to no man is it lawful to judge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++16:18">Dt. 16:18</a>): "Thou shalt appoint judges 
and magistrates in all thy gates . . . that they may judge the people 
with just judgment."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment is lawful in so far as it is an act of justice. 
Now it follows from what has been stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,3) that three 
conditions are requisite for a judgment to be an act of justice: first, 
that it proceed from the inclination of justice; secondly, that it come 
from one who is in authority; thirdly, that it be pronounced according to 
the right ruling of prudence. If any one of these be lacking, the 
judgment will be faulty and unlawful. First, when it is contrary to the 
rectitude of justice, and then it is called "perverted" or "unjust": 
secondly, when a man judges about matters wherein he has no authority, 
and this is called judgment "by usurpation": thirdly, when the reason 
lacks certainty, as when a man, without any solid motive, forms a 
judgment on some doubtful or hidden matter, and then it is called 
judgment by "suspicion" or "rash" judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In these words our Lord forbids rash judgment which is 
about the inward intention, or other uncertain things, as Augustine 
states (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 18). Or else He forbids judgment about 
Divine things, which we ought not to judge, but simply believe, since 
they are above us, as Hilary declares in his commentary on Mt. 5. Or 
again according to Chrysostom [*Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus 
Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John of the Cross], He forbids the 
judgment which proceeds not from benevolence but from bitterness of heart.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A judge is appointed as God's servant; wherefore it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++1:16">Dt. 1:16</a>): "Judge that which is just," and further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++1:17">Dt. 1:17</a>), "because it is the judgment of God."
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who stand guilty of grievous sins should not judge 
those who are guilty of the same or lesser sins, as Chrysostom [*Hom. 
xxiv] says on the words of Mt. 7:1, "Judge not." Above all does this hold 
when such sins are public, because there would be an occasion of scandal 
arising in the hearts of others. If however they are not public but 
hidden, and there be an urgent  necessity for the judge to pronounce 
judgment, because it is his duty, he can reprove or judge with humility 
and fear. Hence Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 19): "If we 
find that we are guilty of the same sin as another man, we should groan 
together with him, and invite him to strive against it together with us." 
And yet it is not through acting thus that a man condemns himself so as 
to deserve to be condemned once again, but when, in condemning another, 
he shows himself to be equally deserving of condemnation on account of 
another or a like sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is unlawful to form a judgment from suspicions?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not unlawful to form a judgment from 
suspicions. For suspicion is seemingly an uncertain opinion about an 
evil, wherefore the Philosopher states (Ethic. vi, 3) that suspicion is 
about both the true and the false. Now it is impossible to have any but 
an uncertain opinion about contingent singulars. Since then human 
judgment is about human acts, which are about singular and contingent 
matters, it seems that no judgment would be lawful, if it were not lawful 
to judge from suspicions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man does his neighbor an injury by judging him 
unlawfully. But an evil suspicion consists in nothing more than a man's 
opinion, and consequently does not seem to pertain to the injury of 
another man. Therefore judgment based on suspicion is not unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if it is unlawful, it must needs be reducible to an 
injustice, since judgment is an act of justice, as stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
Now an injustice is always a mortal sin according to its genus, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>, <A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Therefore a judgment based on suspicion would always 
be a mortal sin, if it were unlawful. But this is false, because "we 
cannot avoid suspicions," according to a gloss of Augustine (Tract. xc in 
Joan.) on 1 Cor. 4:5, "Judge not before the time." Therefore a judgment 
based on suspicion would seem not to be unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Chrysostom [*Hom. xvii in Matth. in the Opus 
Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John of the Cross] in comment on the 
words of Mt. 7:1, "Judge not," etc., says: "By this commandment our Lord 
does not forbid Christians to reprove others from kindly motives, but 
that Christian should despise Christian by boasting his own 
righteousness, by hating and condemning others for the most part on mere 
suspicion."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Tully says (De Invent. Rhet. ii), suspicion denotes 
evil thinking based on slight indications, and this is due to three 
causes. First, from a man being evil in himself, and from this very fact, 
as though conscious of his own wickedness, he is prone to think evil of 
others, according to Eccles. 10:3, "The fool when he walketh in the way, 
whereas he himself is a fool, esteemeth all men fools." Secondly, this is 
due to a man being ill-disposed towards another: for when a man hates or 
despises another, or is angry with or envious of him, he is led by slight 
indications to  think evil of him, because everyone easily believes what 
he desires. Thirdly, this is due to long experience: wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Rhet. ii, 13) that "old people are very suspicious, for 
they have often experienced the faults of others." The first two causes 
of suspicion evidently connote perversity of the affections, while the 
third diminishes the nature of suspicion, in as much as experience leads 
to certainty which is contrary to the nature of suspicion. Consequently 
suspicion denotes a certain amount of vice, and the further it goes, the 
more vicious it is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now there are three degrees of suspicion. The first degree is when a man 
begins to doubt of another's goodness from slight indications. This is a 
venial and a light sin; for "it belongs to human temptation without which 
no man can go through this life," according to a gloss on 1 Cor. 4:5, 
"Judge not before the time." The second degree is when a man, from slight 
indications, esteems another man's wickedness as certain. This is a 
mortal sin, if it be about a grave matter, since it cannot be without 
contempt of one's neighbor. Hence the same gloss goes on to say: "If then 
we cannot avoid suspicions, because we are human, we must nevertheless 
restrain our judgment, and refrain from forming a definite and fixed 
opinion." The third degree is when a judge goes so far as to condemn a 
man on suspicion: this pertains directly to injustice, and consequently 
is a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some kind of certainty is found in human acts, not indeed 
the certainty of a demonstration, but such as is befitting the matter in 
point, for instance when a thing is proved by suitable witnesses.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> From the very fact that a man thinks evil of another 
without sufficient cause, he despises him unduly, and therefore does him 
an injury.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since justice and injustice are about external operations, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58ATHEP1">Articles [8]</a>,10,11; <A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>, <A Href="SS059.html#SSQ59A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), the judgment of 
suspicion pertains directly to injustice when it is betrayed by external 
action, and then it is a mortal sin, as stated above. The internal 
judgment pertains to justice, in so far as it is related to the external 
judgment, even as the internal to the external act, for instance as 
desire is related to fornication, or anger to murder.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that doubts should not be interpreted for the best. 
Because we should judge from what happens for the most part. But it 
happens for the most part that evil is done, since "the number of fools 
is infinite" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++1:15">Eccles. 1:15</a>), "for the imagination and thought of man's 
heart are prone to evil from his youth" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++8:21">Gn. 8:21</a>). Therefore doubts 
should be interpreted for the worst rather than for the best.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Doctr. Christ. i, 27) that "he leads 
a godly and just life who is sound in his estimate of things, and turns 
neither to this side nor to that." Now he who interprets a doubtful point 
for the best, turns to one side. Therefore this should not be done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, man should love his neighbor as himself. Now with regard 
to himself, a man should interpret doubtful matters for the worst, 
according to Job 9:28, "I feared all my works." Therefore it seems that 
doubtful matters affecting one's neighbor should be interpreted for the 
worst.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Rm. 14:3, "He that eateth not, let him not 
judge him that eateth," says: "Doubts should be interpreted in the best 
sense."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2), things from the very fact 
that a man thinks ill of another without sufficient cause, he injures and 
despises him. Now no man ought to despise or in any way injure another 
man without urgent cause: and, consequently, unless we have evident 
indications of a person's wickedness, we ought to deem him good, by 
interpreting for the best whatever is doubtful about him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who interprets doubtful matters for the best, may happen 
to be deceived more often than not; yet it is better to err frequently 
through thinking well of a wicked man, than to err less frequently 
through having an evil opinion of a good man, because in the latter case 
an injury is inflicted, but not in the former.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is one thing to judge of things and another to judge of 
men. For when we judge of things, there is no question of the good or 
evil of the thing about which we are judging, since it will take no harm 
no matter what kind of judgment we form about it; but there is question 
of the good of the person who judges, if he judge truly, and of his evil 
if he judge falsely because "the true is the good of the intellect, and 
the false is its evil," as stated in Ethic. vi, 2, wherefore everyone 
should strive to make his judgment accord with things as they are. On the 
other hand when we judge of men, the good and evil in our judgment is 
considered chiefly on the part of the person about whom judgment is being 
formed; for he is deemed worthy of honor from the very fact that he is 
judged to be good, and deserving of contempt if he is judged to be evil. 
For this reason we ought, in this kind of judgment, to aim at judging a 
man good, unless there is evident proof of the contrary. And though we 
may judge falsely, our judgment in thinking well of another pertains to 
our good feeling and not to the evil of the intellect, even as neither 
does it pertain to the intellect's perfection to know the truth of 
contingent singulars in themselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One may interpret something for the worst or for the best 
in two ways. First, by a kind of supposition; and thus, when we have to 
apply a remedy to some evil, whether our own or  another's, in order for 
the remedy to be applied with greater certainty of a cure, it is 
expedient to take the worst for granted, since if a remedy be efficacious 
against a worse evil, much more is it efficacious against a lesser evil. 
Secondly we may interpret something for the best or for the worst, by 
deciding or determining, and in this case when judging of things we 
should try to interpret each thing according as it is, and when judging 
of persons, to interpret things for the best as stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we should always judge according to the written law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we ought not always to judge according to the 
written law. For we ought always to avoid judging unjustly. But written 
laws sometimes contain injustice, according to Is. 10:1, "Woe to them 
that make wicked laws, and when they write, write injustice." Therefore 
we ought not always to judge according to the written law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, judgment has to be formed about individual happenings. 
But no written law can cover each and every individual happening, as the 
Philosopher declares (Ethic. v, 10). Therefore it seems that we are not 
always bound to judge according to the written law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a law is written in order that the lawgiver's intention 
may be made clear. But it happens sometimes that even if the lawgiver 
himself were present he would judge otherwise. Therefore we ought not 
always to judge according to the written law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Vera Relig. xxxi): "In these earthly 
laws, though men judge about them when they are making them, when once 
they are established and passed, the judges may judge no longer of them, 
but according to them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), judgment is nothing else but a 
decision or determination of what is just. Now a thing becomes just in 
two ways: first by the very nature of the case, and this is called 
"natural right," secondly by some agreement between men, and this is 
called "positive right," as stated above (<A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now laws are 
written for the purpose of manifesting both these rights, but in 
different ways. For the written law does indeed contain natural right, 
but it does not establish it, for the latter derives its force, not from 
the law but from nature: whereas the written law both contains positive 
right, and establishes it by giving it force of authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Hence it is necessary to judge according to the written law, else 
judgment would fall short either of the natural or of the positive right.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the written law does not give force to the natural 
right, so neither can it diminish or annul its force,  because neither 
can man's will change nature. Hence if the written law contains anything 
contrary to the natural right, it is unjust and has no binding force. For 
positive right has no place except where "it matters not," according to 
the natural right, "whether a thing be done in one way or in another"; as 
stated above (<A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57OUTP1">Question [57]</a>, <A Href="SS057.html#SSQ57A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Wherefore such documents are to be 
called, not laws, but rather corruptions of law, as stated above (FS, 
Question [95], Article [2]): and consequently judgment should not be delivered according 
to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even as unjust laws by their very nature are, either always 
or for the most part, contrary to the natural right, so too laws that are 
rightly established, fail in some cases, when if they were observed they 
would be contrary to the natural right. Wherefore in such cases judgment 
should be delivered, not according to the letter of the law, but 
according to equity which the lawgiver has in view. Hence the jurist says 
[*Digest. i, 3; De leg. senatusque consult. 25]: "By no reason of law, or 
favor of equity, is it allowable for us to interpret harshly, and render 
burdensome, those useful measures which have been enacted for the welfare 
of man." In such cases even the lawgiver himself would decide otherwise; 
and if he had foreseen the case, he might have provided for it by law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether judgment is rendered perverse by being usurped?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that judgment is not rendered perverse by being 
usurped. For justice is rectitude in matters of action. Now truth is not 
impaired, no matter who tells it, but it may suffer from the person who 
ought to accept it. Therefore again justice loses nothing, no matter who 
declares what is just, and this is what is meant by judgment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to judgment to punish sins. Now it is related 
to the praise of some that they punished sins without having authority 
over those whom they punished; such as Moses in slaying the Egyptian (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++2:12">Ex. 2:12</a>), and Phinees the son of Eleazar in slaying Zambri the son of Salu 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++25:7-14">Num. 25:7-14</a>), and "it was reputed to him unto justice" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++105:31">Ps. 105:31</a>). 
Therefore usurpation of judgment pertains not to injustice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, spiritual power is distinct from temporal. Now prelates 
having spiritual power sometimes interfere in matters concerning the 
secular power. Therefore usurped judgment is not unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, even as the judge requires authority in order to judge 
aright, so also does he need justice and knowledge, as shown above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,3; <A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But a judgment is not described as unjust, if he who 
judges lacks the habit of justice or the knowledge of the law. Neither 
therefore is it always unjust to judge by usurpation, i.e. without 
authority. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++14:4">Rm. 14:4</a>): "Who art thou that judgest 
another man's servant?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since judgment should be pronounced according to the 
written law, as stated above (<A Href="SS060.html#SSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), he that pronounces judgment, 
interprets, in a way, the letter of the law, by applying it to some 
particular case. Now since it belongs to the same authority to interpret 
and to make a law, just as a law cannot be made save by public authority, 
so neither can a judgment be pronounced except by public authority, which 
extends over those who are subject to the community. Wherefore even as it 
would be unjust for one man to force another to observe a law that was 
not approved by public authority, so too it is unjust, if a man compels 
another to submit to a judgment that is pronounced by other than the 
public authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the truth is declared there is no obligation to accept 
it, and each one is free to receive it or not, as he wishes. On the other 
hand judgment implies an obligation, wherefore it is unjust for anyone to 
be judged by one who has no public authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Moses seems to have slain the Egyptian by authority 
received as it were, by divine inspiration; this seems to follow from 
Acts 7:24, 25, where it is said that "striking the Egyptian . . . he 
thought that his brethren understood that God by his hand would save 
Israel [Vulg.: 'them']." Or it may be replied that Moses slew the 
Egyptian in order to defend the man who was unjustly attacked, without 
himself exceeding the limits of a blameless defence. Wherefore Ambrose 
says (De Offic. i, 36) that "whoever does not ward off a blow from a 
fellow man when he can, is as much in fault as the striker"; and he 
quotes the example of Moses. Again we may reply with Augustine (Questions. Exod. 
qu. 2) [*Cf. Contra Faust. xxii, 70] that just as "the soil gives proof 
of its fertility by producing useless herbs before the useful seeds have 
grown, so this deed of Moses was sinful although it gave a sign of great 
fertility," in so far, to wit, as it was a sign of the power whereby he 
was to deliver his people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; With regard to Phinees the reply is that he did this out of zeal for God 
by Divine inspiration; or because though not as yet high-priest, he was 
nevertheless the high-priest's son, and this judgment was his concern as 
of the other judges, to whom this was commanded [*Ex. 22:20; Lev. 20; Dt. 
13,17].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The secular power is subject to the spiritual, even as the 
body is subject to the soul. Consequently the judgment is not usurped if 
the spiritual authority interferes in those temporal matters that are 
subject to the spiritual authority or which have been committed to the 
spiritual by the temporal authority.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[60] A[6] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The habits of knowledge and justice are  perfections of the 
individual, and consequently their absence does not make a judgment to be 
usurped, as in the absence of public authority which gives a judgment its 
coercive force.<br>
