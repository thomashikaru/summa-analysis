OF SUPERSTITION (TWO ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In due sequence we must consider the vices that are opposed to religion. 
First we shall consider those which agree with religion in giving worship 
to God; secondly, we shall treat of those vices which are manifestly 
contrary to religion, through showing contempt of those things that 
pertain to the worship of God. The former come under the head of 
superstition, the latter under that of irreligion. Accordingly we must 
consider in the first place, superstition and its parts, and afterwards 
irreligion and its parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ92A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether superstition is a vice opposed to religion?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ92A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it has several parts or species?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that superstition is not a vice contrary to 
religion. One contrary is not included in the definition of the other. 
But religion is included in the definition of superstition:  for the 
latter is defined as being "immoderate observance of religion," according 
to a gloss on Col. 2:23, "Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in 
superstition." Therefore superstition is not a vice contrary to religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. x): "Cicero [*De Natura Deorum ii, 
28] states that the superstitious were so called because they spent the 
day in praying and offering sacrifices that their children might survive 
[superstites] them." But this may be done even in accordance with true 
religious worship. Therefore superstition is not a vice opposed to 
religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, superstition seems to denote an excess. But religion 
admits of no excess, since, as stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 3), there is 
no possibility of rendering to God, by religion, the equal of what we owe 
Him. Therefore superstition is not a vice contrary to religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Decem Chord. Serm. ix): "Thou 
strikest the first chord in the worship of one God, and the beast of 
superstition hath fallen." Now the worship of one God belongs to 
religion. Therefore superstition is contrary to religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), religion is a moral 
virtue. Now every moral virtue observes a mean, as stated above (FS, 
Question [64], Article [1]). Therefore a twofold vice is opposed to a moral virtue. One 
by way of excess, the other by way of deficiency. Again, the mean of 
virtue may be exceeded, not only with regard to the circumstance called 
"how much," but also with regard to other circumstances: so that, in 
certain virtues such as magnanimity and magnificence; vice exceeds the 
mean of virtue, not through tending to something greater than the virtue, 
but possibly to something less, and yet it goes beyond the mean of 
virtue, through doing something to whom it ought not, or when it ought 
not, and in like manner as regards other circumstances, as the 
Philosopher shows (Ethic. iv, 1,2,3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly superstition is a vice contrary to religion by excess, not 
that it offers more to the divine worship than true religion, but because 
it offers divine worship either to whom it ought not, or in a manner it 
ought not.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as we speak metaphorically of good among evil 
things---thus we speak of a good thief---so too sometimes the names of 
the virtues are employed by transposition in an evil sense. Thus prudence 
is sometimes used instead of cunning, according to Lk. 16:8, "The 
children of this world are more prudent [Douay: 'wiser'] in their 
generation than the children of light." It is in this way that 
superstition is described as religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The etymology of a word differs from its meaning. For its 
etymology depends on what it is taken from for the purpose of 
signification: whereas its meaning depends on the thing to which  it is 
applied for the purpose of signifying it. Now these things differ 
sometimes: for "lapis" [a stone] takes its name from hurting the foot 
[laedere pedem], but this is not its meaning, else iron, since it hurts 
the foot, would be a stone. In like manner it does not follow that 
"superstition" means that from which the word is derived.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Religion does not admit of excess, in respect of absolute 
quantity, but it does admit of excess in respect of proportionate 
quantity, in so far, to wit, as something may be done in divine worship 
that ought not to be done.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether there are various species of superstition?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there are not various species of superstition. 
According to the Philosopher (Topic. i, 13), "if one contrary includes 
many kinds, so does the other." Now religion, to which superstition is 
contrary, does not include various species; but all its acts belong to 
the one species. Therefore neither has superstition various species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, opposites relate to one same thing. But religion, to 
which superstition is opposed, relates to those things whereby we are 
directed to God, as stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore superstition, 
which is opposed to religion, is not specified according to divinations 
of human occurrences, or by the observances of certain human actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Col. 2:23, "Which things have . . . a show of 
wisdom in superstition," adds: "that is to say in a hypocritical 
religion." Therefore hypocrisy should be reckoned a species of 
superstition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine assigns the various species of superstition 
(De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above, sins against religion consist in going 
beyond the mean of virtue in respect of certain circumstances (<A Href="SS092.html#SSQ92A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For 
as we have stated (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>), not every diversity of corrupt 
circumstances differentiates the species of a sin, but only that which is 
referred to diverse objects, for diverse ends: since it is in this 
respect that moral acts are diversified specifically, as stated above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,6).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly the species of superstition are differentiated, first on the 
part of the mode, secondly on the part of the object. For the divine 
worship may be given either to whom it ought to be given, namely, to the 
true God, but "in an undue mode," and this is the first species of 
superstition; or to whom it ought not to be given, namely, to any 
creature whatsoever, and this is another genus of superstition, divided 
into many species in respect of the various ends of divine worship. For 
the end of divine worship is in  the first place to give reverence to 
God, and in this respect the first species of this genus is "idolatry," 
which unduly gives divine honor to a creature. The second end of religion 
is that man may be taught by God Whom he worships; and to this must be 
referred "divinatory" superstition, which consults the demons through 
compacts made with them, whether tacit or explicit. Thirdly, the end of 
divine worship is a certain direction of human acts according to the 
precepts of God the object of that worship: and to this must be referred 
the superstition of certain "observances."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Augustine alludes to these three (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 20), where he 
says that "anything invented by man for making and worshipping idols is 
superstitious," and this refers to the first species. Then he goes on to 
say, "or any agreement or covenant made with the demons for the purpose 
of consultation and of compact by tokens," which refers to the second 
species; and a little further on he adds: "To this kind belong all sorts 
of amulets and such like," and this refers to the third species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv), "good results from a 
cause that is one and entire, whereas evil arises from each single 
defect." Wherefore several vices are opposed to one virtue, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS092.html#SSQ92A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). The saying of the Philosopher is true of 
opposites wherein there is the same reason of multiplicity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Divinations and certain observances come under the head of 
superstition, in so far as they depend on certain actions of the demons: 
and thus they pertain to compacts made with them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[92] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Hypocritical religion is taken here for "religion as 
applied to human observances," as the gloss goes on to explain. Wherefore 
this hypocritical religion is nothing else than worship given to God in 
an undue mode: as, for instance, if a man were, in the time of grace, to 
wish to worship God according to the rite of the Old Law. It is of 
religion taken in this sense that the gloss speaks literally.<br>
