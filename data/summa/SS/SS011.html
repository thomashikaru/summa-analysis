<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that heresy is not a species of unbelief. For 
unbelief is in the understanding, as stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now 
heresy would seem not to pertain to the understanding, but rather to the 
appetitive power; for Jerome says on Gal. 5:19: [*Cf. Decretals xxiv, qu. 
iii, cap. 27] "The works of the flesh are manifest: Heresy is derived 
from a Greek word meaning choice, whereby a man makes choice of that 
school which he deems best." But choice is an act of the appetitive 
power, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore heresy is not a 
species of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, vice takes its species chiefly from its end; hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he who commits adultery that he may 
steal, is a thief rather than an adulterer." Now the end of heresy is 
temporal profit, especially lordship and glory, which belong to the vice 
of pride or covetousness: for Augustine says (De Util. Credendi i) that 
"a heretic is one who either devises or follows false and new opinions, 
for the sake of some temporal profit, especially that he may lord and be 
honored above others." Therefore heresy is a species of pride rather than 
of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since unbelief is in the understanding, it would seem 
not to pertain to the flesh. Now heresy belongs to the works of the 
flesh, for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++5:19">Gal. 5:19</a>): "The works of the flesh are 
manifest, which are fornication, uncleanness," and among the others, he 
adds, "dissensions, sects," which are the same as heresies. Therefore 
heresy is not a species of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Falsehood is contrary to truth. Now a heretic is one 
who devises or follows false or new opinions. Therefore heresy is opposed 
to the truth, on which faith is founded; and consequently it is a species 
of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The word heresy as stated in the first objection denotes 
a choosing. Now choice as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) is about things 
directed to the end, the end being presupposed. Now, in matters of faith, 
the will assents to some truth, as to its proper good, as was shown above 
(<A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): wherefore that which is the chief truth, has the character 
of last end, while those which are secondary truths, have the character 
of being directed to the end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, whoever believes, assents to someone's words; so that, in every 
form of unbelief, the person to whose words assent is given seems to hold 
the chief place and to be the end as it were; while the things by holding 
which one assents to that person hold a secondary place. Consequently he 
that holds the Christian faith aright, assents, by his will, to Christ, 
in those things which truly belong to His doctrine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly there are two ways in which a man may deviate from the 
rectitude of the Christian faith. First, because he is unwilling to 
assent to Christ: and such a man has an evil will, so to say, in respect 
of the very end. This belongs to the species of unbelief in pagans and 
Jews. Secondly, because, though he intends to assent to Christ, yet he 
fails in his choice of those things wherein he assents to Christ, because 
he chooses not what Christ really taught, but the suggestions of his own 
mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore heresy is a species of unbelief, belonging to those who 
profess the Christian faith, but corrupt its dogmas.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Choice regards unbelief in the same way as the will regards 
faith, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vices take their species from their proximate end, while, 
from their remote end, they take their genus and cause. Thus in the case 
of adultery committed for the sake of theft, there is the species of 
adultery taken from its proper end and object; but the ultimate end shows 
that the act of adultery is both the result of the theft, and is included 
under it, as an effect under its cause, or a species under its genus, as 
appears from what we have said about acts in general (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). 
Wherefore, as to the case in point also, the proximate end of heresy is 
adherence to one's own false opinion, and from this it derives its 
species,  while its remote end reveals its cause, viz. that it arises 
from pride or covetousness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as heresy is so called from its being a choosing 
[*From the Greek {airein} [hairein], to cut off], so does sect derive its 
name from its being a cutting off [secando], as Isidore states (Etym. 
viii, 3). Wherefore heresy and sect are the same thing, and each belongs 
to the works of the flesh, not indeed by reason of the act itself of 
unbelief in respect of its proximate object, but by reason of its cause, 
which is either the desire of an undue end in which way it arises from 
pride or covetousness, as stated in the second objection, or some 
illusion of the imagination (which gives rise to error, as the 
Philosopher states in Metaph. iv; Ed. Did. iii, 5), for this faculty has 
a certain connection with the flesh, in as much as its act is independent 
on a bodily organ.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether heresy is properly about matters of faith?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that heresy is not properly about matters of faith. 
For just as there are heresies and sects among Christians, so were there 
among the Jews, and Pharisees, as Isidore observes (Etym. viii, 3,4,5). 
Now their dissensions were not about matters of faith. Therefore heresy 
is not about matters of faith, as though they were its proper matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the matter of faith is the thing believed. Now heresy is 
not only about things, but also about works, and about interpretations of 
Holy Writ. For Jerome says on Gal. 5:20 that "whoever expounds the 
Scriptures in any sense but that of the Holy Ghost by Whom they were 
written, may be called a heretic, though he may not have left the 
Church": and elsewhere he says that "heresies spring up from words spoken 
amiss." [*St. Thomas quotes this saying elsewhere, in Sent. iv, D, 13, 
and TP, Question [16], Article [8], but it is not to be found in St. Jerome's works.] 
Therefore heresy is not properly about the matter of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we find the holy doctors differing even about matters 
pertaining to the faith, for example Augustine and Jerome, on the 
question about the cessation of the legal observances: and yet this was 
without any heresy on their part. Therefore heresy is not properly about 
the matter of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says against the Manichees [*Cf. De Civ. Dei 
xviii, 51]: "In Christ's Church, those are heretics, who hold mischievous 
and erroneous opinions, and when rebuked that they may think soundly and 
rightly, offer a stubborn resistance, and, refusing to mend their 
pernicious and deadly doctrines, persist in defending them." Now 
pernicious and deadly doctrines are none but those which are contrary to 
the dogmas of faith, whereby "the just man liveth" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:17">Rm. 1:17</a>). Therefore 
heresy is about matters of faith, as about its proper matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] Body Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We are speaking of heresy now as denoting a corruption of 
the Christian faith. Now it does not imply a corruption of the Christian 
faith, if a man has a false opinion in matters that are not of faith, for 
instance, in questions of geometry and so forth, which cannot belong to 
the faith by any means; but only when a person has a false opinion about 
things belonging to the faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now a thing may be of the faith in two ways, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP032.html#FPQ32A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), in one way, directly and 
principally, e.g. the articles of faith; in another way, indirectly and 
secondarily, e.g. those matters, the denial of which leads to the 
corruption of some article of faith; and there may be heresy in either 
way, even as there can be faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the heresies of the Jews and Pharisees were about 
opinions relating to Judaism or Pharisaism, so also heresies among 
Christians are about matter touching the Christian faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man is said to expound Holy Writ in another sense than 
that required by the Holy Ghost, when he so distorts the meaning of Holy 
Writ, that it is contrary to what the Holy Ghost has revealed. Hence it 
is written (Ezech. 13:6) about the false prophets: "They have persisted 
to confirm what they have said," viz. by false interpretations of 
Scripture. Moreover a man professes his faith by the words that he 
utters, since confession is an act of faith, as stated above (<A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore inordinate words about matters of faith may lead to 
corruption of the faith; and hence it is that Pope Leo says in a letter 
to Proterius, Bishop of Alexandria: "The enemies of Christ's cross lie in 
wait for our every deed and word, so that, if we but give them the 
slightest pretext, they may accuse us mendaciously of agreeing with 
Nestorius."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Ep. xliii) and we find it stated in the 
Decretals (xxiv, qu. 3, can. Dixit Apostolus): "By no means should we 
accuse of heresy those who, however false and perverse their opinion may 
be, defend it without obstinate fervor, and seek the truth with careful 
anxiety, ready to mend their opinion, when they have found the truth," 
because, to wit, they do not make a choice in contradiction to the 
doctrine of the Church. Accordingly, certain doctors seem to have 
differed either in matters the holding of which in this or that way is of 
no consequence, so far as faith is concerned, or even in matters of 
faith, which were not as yet defined by the Church; although if anyone 
were obstinately to deny them after they had been defined by the 
authority of the universal Church, he would be deemed a heretic. This 
authority resides chiefly in the Sovereign Pontiff. For we read [*Decret. 
xxiv, qu. 1, can. Quoties]: "Whenever a question of faith is in dispute, 
I think, that all our brethren and fellow bishops ought to refer the 
matter to none other than Peter, as being the source of their name and 
honor, against whose authority neither Jerome nor Augustine nor any of 
the holy doctors  defended their opinion." Hence Jerome says (Exposit. 
Symbol [*Among the supposititious works of St. Jerome]): "This, most 
blessed Pope, is the faith that we have been taught in the Catholic 
Church. If anything therein has been incorrectly or carelessly expressed, 
we beg that it may be set aright by you who hold the faith and see of 
Peter. If however this, our profession, be approved by the judgment of 
your apostleship, whoever may blame me, will prove that he himself is 
ignorant, or malicious, or even not a catholic but a heretic."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether heretics ought to be tolerated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that heretics ought to be tolerated. For the Apostle 
says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Tim++2:24,25">2 Tim. 2:24,25</a>): "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle . . . 
with modesty admonishing them that resist the truth, if peradventure God 
may give them repentance to know the truth, and they may recover 
themselves from the snares of the devil." Now if heretics are not 
tolerated but put to death, they lose the opportunity of repentance. 
Therefore it seems contrary to the Apostle's command.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is necessary in the Church should be tolerated. 
Now heresies are necessary in the Church, since the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++11:19">1 Cor. 11:19</a>): "There must be . . . heresies, that they . . . who are reproved, 
may be manifest among you." Therefore it seems that heretics should be 
tolerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Master commanded his servants (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++13:30">Mt. 13:30</a>) to suffer 
the cockle "to grow until the harvest," i.e. the end of the world, as a 
gloss explains it. Now holy men explain that the cockle denotes heretics. 
Therefore heretics should be tolerated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Titus+3:10,11">Titus 3:10,11</a>): "A man that is a 
heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid: knowing that he, 
that is such an one, is subverted."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> With regard to heretics two points must be observed: one, 
on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On their own 
side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be separated from 
the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from the world by 
death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith which quickens 
the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life. Wherefore if 
forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned to death by 
the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics, as soon as 
they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but even put 
to death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy which looks to the 
conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but 
"after the first and second admonition," as the Apostle directs: after 
that, if he is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his 
conversion, looks to the salvation of others, by  excommunicating him and 
separating him from the Church, and furthermore delivers him to the 
secular tribunal to be exterminated thereby from the world by death. For 
Jerome commenting on Gal. 5:9, "A little leaven," says: "Cut off the 
decayed flesh, expel the mangy sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, 
the whole paste, the whole body, the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die. 
Arius was but one spark in Alexandria, but as that spark was not at once 
put out, the whole earth was laid waste by its flame."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This very modesty demands that the heretic should be 
admonished a first and second time: and if he be unwilling to retract, he 
must be reckoned as already "subverted," as we may gather from the words 
of the Apostle quoted above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The profit that ensues from heresy is beside the intention 
of heretics, for it consists in the constancy of the faithful being put 
to the test, and "makes us shake off our sluggishness, and search the 
Scriptures more carefully," as Augustine states (De Gen. cont. Manich. i, 
1). What they really intend is the corruption of the faith, which is to 
inflict very great harm indeed. Consequently we should consider what they 
directly intend, and expel them, rather than what is beside their 
intention, and so, tolerate them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Decret. (xxiv, qu. iii, can. Notandum), "to be 
excommunicated is not to be uprooted." A man is excommunicated, as the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++5:5">1 Cor. 5:5</a>) that his "spirit may be saved in the day of Our 
Lord." Yet if heretics be altogether uprooted by death, this is not 
contrary to Our Lord's command, which is to be understood as referring to 
the case when the cockle cannot be plucked up without plucking up the 
wheat, as we explained above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>, ad 1), when treating of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Church ought in all cases to receive those 
who return from heresy. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++3:1">Jer. 3:1</a>) in the person of the 
Lord: "Thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers; nevertheless return 
to Me saith the Lord." Now the sentence of the Church is God's sentence, 
according to Dt. 1:17: "You shall hear the little as well as the great: 
neither shall you respect any man's person, because it is the judgment of 
God." Therefore even those who are guilty of the prostitution of unbelief 
which is spiritual prostitution, should be received all the same.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Our Lord commanded Peter (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++18:22">Mt. 18:22</a>) to forgive his 
offending brother "not" only "till seven times, but till seventy times 
seven times," which Jerome expounds as meaning that "a man should be 
forgiven, as often as he has sinned." Therefore he ought to be received 
by the Church as often as he has sinned by falling back into heresy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, heresy is a kind of unbelief. Now other  unbelievers who 
wish to be converted are received by the Church. Therefore heretics also 
should be received.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Decretal Ad abolendam (De Haereticis, cap. ix) says 
that "those who are found to have relapsed into the error which they had 
already abjured, must be left to the secular tribunal." Therefore they 
should not be received by the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In obedience to Our Lord's institution, the Church 
extends her charity to all, not only to friends, but also to foes who 
persecute her, according to Mt. 5:44: "Love your enemies; do good to them 
that hate you." Now it is part of charity that we should both wish and 
work our neighbor's good. Again, good is twofold: one is spiritual, 
namely the health of the soul, which good is chiefly the object of 
charity, since it is this chiefly that we should wish for one another. 
Consequently, from this point of view, heretics who return after falling 
no matter how often, are admitted by the Church to Penance whereby the 
way of salvation is opened to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other good is that which charity considers secondarily, viz. 
temporal good, such as life of the body, worldly possessions, good 
repute, ecclesiastical or secular dignity, for we are not bound by 
charity to wish others this good, except in relation to the eternal 
salvation of them and of others. Hence if the presence of one of these 
goods in one individual might be an obstacle to eternal salvation in 
many, we are not bound out of charity to wish such a good to that person, 
rather should we desire him to be without it, both because eternal 
salvation takes precedence of temporal good, and because the good of the 
many is to be preferred to the good of one. Now if heretics were always 
received on their return, in order to save their lives and other temporal 
goods, this might be prejudicial to the salvation of others, both because 
they would infect others if they relapsed again, and because, if they 
escaped without punishment, others would feel more assured in lapsing 
into heresy. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eccles++8:11">Eccles. 8:11</a>): "For because sentence is 
not speedily pronounced against the evil, the children of men commit 
evils without any fear."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return 
from heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and 
sometimes by dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities 
which they may have had before, should their conversion appear to be 
sincere: we read of this as having frequently been done for the good of 
peace. But when they fall again, after having been received, this seems 
to prove them to be inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return 
again, they are admitted to Penance, but are not delivered from the pain 
of death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In God's tribunal, those who return are always received, 
because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who return in 
sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she presumes 
that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere in 
their return; hence she does not debar them from the  way of salvation, 
but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord was speaking to Peter of sins committed against 
oneself, for one should always forgive such offenses and spare our 
brother when he repents. These words are not to be applied to sins 
committed against one's neighbor or against God, for it is not left to 
our discretion to forgive such offenses, as Jerome says on Mt. 18:15, "If 
thy brother shall offend against thee." Yet even in this matter the law 
prescribes limits according as God's honor or our neighbor's good demands.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[11] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When other unbelievers, who have never received the faith 
are converted, they do not as yet show signs of inconstancy in faith, as 
relapsed heretics do; hence the comparison fails.<br>
