<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vices opposed to magnanimity; and in the first 
place, those that are opposed thereto by excess. These are three, namely, 
presumption, ambition, and vainglory. Secondly, we shall consider 
pusillanimity which is opposed to it by way of deficiency. Under the 
first head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ130A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether presumption is a sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ130A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is opposed to magnanimity by excess?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that presumption is not a sin. For the Apostle says: 
"Forgetting the things that are behind, I stretch forth [Vulg.: 'and 
stretching forth'] myself to those that are before." But it seems to 
savor of presumption that one should tend to what is above oneself. 
Therefore presumption is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 7) "we should not listen 
to those who would persuade us to relish human things because we are men, 
or mortal things because we are mortal, but we should relish those that 
make us immortal": and (Metaph. i) "that man should pursue divine things 
as far as possible." Now divine and immortal things are seemingly far 
above man. Since then presumption consists essentially in tending to what 
is above oneself, it seems that presumption is something praiseworthy, 
rather than a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Cor++3:5">2 Cor. 3:5</a>): "Not that we are 
sufficient to think anything of ourselves, as of ourselves." If then 
presumption, by which one strives at that for which one is not 
sufficient, be a sin, it seems that man cannot lawfully even think of 
anything good: which is absurd. Therefore presumption is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 37:3): "O wicked presumption, 
whence camest thou?" and a gloss answers: "From a creature's evil will." 
Now all that comes of the root of an evil will is a sin. Therefore 
presumption is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since whatever is according to nature, is ordered by the 
Divine Reason, which human reason ought to imitate, whatever is done in 
accordance with human reason in opposition to  the order established in 
general throughout natural things is vicious and sinful. Now it is 
established throughout all natural things, that every action is 
commensurate with the power of the agent, nor does any natural agent 
strive to do what exceeds its ability. Hence it is vicious and sinful, as 
being contrary to the natural order, that any one should assume to do 
what is above his power: and this is what is meant by presumption, as its 
very name shows. Wherefore it is evident that presumption is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Nothing hinders that which is above the active power of a 
natural thing, and yet not above the passive power of that same thing: 
thus the air is possessed of a passive power by reason of which it can be 
so changed as to obtain the action and movement of fire, which surpass 
the active power of air. Thus too it would be sinful and presumptuous for 
a man while in a state of imperfect virtue to attempt the immediate 
accomplishment of what belongs to perfect virtue. But it is not 
presumptuous or sinful for a man to endeavor to advance towards perfect 
virtue. In this way the Apostle stretched himself forth to the things 
that were before him, namely continually advancing forward.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Divine and immortal things surpass man according to the 
order of nature. Yet man is possessed of a natural power, namely the 
intellect, whereby he can be united to immortal and Divine things. In 
this respect the Philosopher says that "man ought to pursue immortal and 
divine things," not that he should do what it becomes God to do, but that 
he should be united to Him in intellect and will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 3), "what we can do by 
the help of others we can do by ourselves in a sense." Hence since we can 
think and do good by the help of God, this is not altogether above our 
ability. Hence it is not presumptuous for a man to attempt the 
accomplishment of a virtuous deed: but it would be presumptuous if one 
were to make the attempt without confidence in God's assistance.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether presumption is opposed to magnanimity by excess?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that presumption is not opposed to magnanimity by 
excess. For presumption is accounted a species of the sin against the 
Holy Ghost, as stated above (<A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS021.html#SSQ21OUTP1">Question [21]</a>, <A Href="SS021.html#SSQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But the sin 
against the Holy Ghost is not opposed to magnanimity, but to charity. 
Neither therefore is presumption opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to magnanimity that one should deem oneself 
worthy of great things. But a man is said to be presumptuous even if he 
deem himself worthy of small things, if they surpass his ability. 
Therefore presumption is not directly opposed to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the magnanimous man looks upon external goods as little 
things. Now according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 3),  "on account of 
external fortune the presumptuous disdain and wrong others, because they 
deem external goods as something great." Therefore presumption is opposed 
to magnanimity, not by excess, but only by deficiency.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 3) that the 
"vain man," i.e. a vaporer or a wind-bag, which with us denotes a 
presumptuous man, "is opposed to the magnanimous man by excess."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS129.html#SSQ129OUTP1">Question [129]</a>, <A Href="SS129.html#SSQ129A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), magnanimity 
observes the means, not as regards the quantity of that to which it 
tends, but in proportion to our own ability: for it does not tend to 
anything greater than is becoming to us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the presumptuous man, as regards that to which he tends, does not 
exceed the magnanimous, but sometimes falls far short of him: but he does 
exceed in proportion to his own ability, whereas the magnanimous man does 
not exceed his. It is in this way that presumption is opposed to 
magnanimity by excess.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not every presumption that is accounted a sin against 
the Holy Ghost, but that by which one contemns the Divine justice through 
inordinate confidence in the Divine mercy. The latter kind of 
presumption, by reason of its matter, inasmuch, to wit, as it implies 
contempt of something Divine, is opposed to charity, or rather to the 
gift of fear, whereby we revere God. Nevertheless, in so far as this 
contempt exceeds the proportion to one's own ability, it can be opposed 
to magnanimity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Presumption, like magnanimity, seems to tend to something 
great. For we are not, as a rule, wont to call a man presumptuous for 
going beyond his powers in something small. If, however, such a man be 
called presumptuous, this kind of presumption is not opposed to 
magnanimity, but to that virtue which is about ordinary honor, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS129.html#SSQ129OUTP1">Question [129]</a>, <A Href="SS129.html#SSQ129A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> No one attempts what is above his ability, except in so far 
as he deems his ability greater than it is. In this one may err in two 
ways. First only as regards quantity, as when a man thinks he has greater 
virtue, or knowledge, or the like, than he has. Secondly, as regards the 
kind of thing, as when he thinks himself great, and worthy of great 
things, by reason of something that does not make him so, for instance by 
reason of riches or goods of fortune. For, as the Philosopher says 
(Ethic. iv, 3), "those who have these things without virtue, neither 
justly deem themselves worthy of great things, nor are rightly called 
magnanimous."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[130] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, the thing to which a man sometimes tends in excess of his 
ability, is sometimes in very truth something great, simply as in the 
case of Peter, whose intent was to suffer for Christ, which has exceeded 
his power; while sometimes it is something great, not simply, but only in 
the opinion of fools, such as wearing costly  clothes, despising and 
wronging others. This savors of an excess of magnanimity, not in any 
truth, but in people's opinion. Hence Seneca says (De Quat. Virtut.) that 
"when magnanimity exceeds its measure, it makes a man high-handed, proud, 
haughty restless, and bent on excelling in all things, whether in words 
or in deeds, without any considerations of virtue." Thus it is evident 
that the presumptuous man sometimes falls short of the magnanimous in 
reality, although in appearance he surpasses him.<br>
