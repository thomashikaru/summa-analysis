<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider modesty: and (1) Modesty in general; (2) Each of 
its species. Under the first head there are two points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ160A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether modesty is a part of temperance?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ160A2THEP1">(2)</a> What is the matter of modesty?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that modesty is not a part of temperance. For 
modesty is denominated from mode. Now mode is requisite in every virtue: 
since virtue is directed to good; and "good," according to Augustine (De 
Nat. Boni 3), "consists in mode, species, and order." Therefore modesty 
is a general virtue, and consequently should not be reckoned a part of 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance would seem to be deserving of praise chiefly 
on account of its moderation. Now this gives modesty its name. Therefore 
modesty is the same as temperance, and not one of its parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, modesty would seem to regard the correction of our 
neighbor, according to 2 Tim. 2:24,25, "The servant of the Lord must not 
wrangle, but be mild towards all men . . . with modesty admonishing them 
that resist the truth." Now admonishing wrong-doers is an act of justice 
or of charity, as stated above (<A Href="SS033.html#SSQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>, <A Href="SS033.html#SSQ33A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore seemingly modesty 
is a part of justice rather than of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) reckons modesty as a 
part of temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>; <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157OUTP1">Question [157]</a>, <A Href="SS157.html#SSQ157A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), temperance 
brings moderation into those things wherein it is most  difficult to be 
moderate, namely the concupiscences of pleasures of touch. Now whenever 
there is a special virtue about some matter of very great moment, there 
must needs be another virtue about matters of lesser import: because the 
life of man requires to be regulated by the virtues with regard to 
everything: thus it was stated above (<A Href="SS134.html#SSQ134OUTP1">Question [134]</a>, <A Href="SS134.html#SSQ134A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1), that while 
magnificence is about great expenditure, there is need in addition for 
liberality, which is concerned with ordinary expenditure. Hence there is 
need for a virtue to moderate other lesser matters where moderation is 
not so difficult. This virtue is called modesty, and is annexed to 
temperance as its principal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a name is common to many it is sometimes appropriated 
to those of the lowest rank; thus the common name of angel is 
appropriated to the lowest order of angels. In the same way, mode which 
is observed by all virtues in common, is specially appropriated to the 
virtue which prescribes the mode in the slightest things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some things need tempering on account of their strength, 
thus we temper strong wine. But moderation is necessary in all things: 
wherefore temperance is more concerned with strong passions, and modesty 
about weaker passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Modesty is to be taken there for the general moderation 
which is necessary in all virtues.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether modesty is only about outward actions?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that modesty is only about outward actions. For the 
inward movements of the passions cannot be known to other persons. Yet 
the Apostle enjoins (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++4:5">Phil. 4:5</a>): "Let your modesty be known to all men." 
Therefore modesty is only about outward actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the virtues that are about the passions are 
distinguished from justice which is about operations. Now modesty is 
seemingly one virtue. Therefore, if it be about outward works, it will 
not be concerned with inward passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one same virtue is both about things pertaining to 
the appetite---which is proper to the moral virtues---and about things 
pertaining to knowledge---which is proper to the intellectual 
virtues---and again about things pertaining to the irascible and 
concupiscible faculties. Therefore, if modesty be one virtue, it cannot 
be about all these things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In all these things it is necessary to observe the 
"mode" whence modesty takes its name. Therefore modesty is about all of 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS160.html#SSQ160A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), modesty differs from temperance, 
in that temperance moderates those matters where  restraint is most 
difficult, while modesty moderates those that present less difficulty. 
Authorities seem to have had various opinions about modesty. For wherever 
they found a special kind of good or a special difficulty of moderation, 
they withdrew it from the province of modesty, which they confined to 
lesser matters. Now it is clear to all that the restraint of pleasures of 
touch presents a special difficulty: wherefore all distinguished 
temperance from modesty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In addition to this, moreover, Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii, 54) 
considered that there was a special kind of good in the moderation of 
punishment; wherefore he severed clemency also from modesty, and held 
modesty to be about the remaining ordinary matters that require 
moderation. These seemingly are of four kinds. one is the movement of the 
mind towards some excellence, and this is moderated by "humility." The 
second is the desire of things pertaining to knowledge, and this is 
moderated by "studiousness" which is opposed to curiosity. The third 
regards bodily movements and actions, which require to be done becomingly 
and honestly [*Cf. Question [145], Article [1]], whether we act seriously or in play. 
The fourth regards outward show, for instance in dress and the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; To some of these matters, however, other authorities appointed certain 
special virtues: thus Andronicus [*De Affectibus] mentions "meekness, 
simplicity, humility," and other kindred virtues, of which we have spoken 
above (<A Href="SS143.html#SSQ143OUTP1">Question [143]</a>); while Aristotle (Ethic. ii, 7) assigned {eutrapelia} to 
pleasures in games, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). All these are 
comprised under modesty as understood by Tully; and in this way modesty 
regards not only outward but also inward actions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Apostle speaks of modesty as regarding externals. 
Nevertheless the moderation of the inner man may be shown by certain 
outward signs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Various virtues assigned by various authorities are 
comprised under modesty. Wherefore nothing prevents modesty from 
regarding matters which require different virtues. Yet there is not so 
great a difference between the various parts of modesty, as there is 
between justice, which is about operations, and temperance, which is 
about passions, because in actions and passions that present no great 
difficulty on the part of the matter, but only on the part of moderation, 
there is but one virtue, one namely for each kind of moderation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[160] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore the Reply to the Third Objection also is clear.
