<H3 Align="Left">Whether prophecy is fittingly divided into the prophecy of divine predestination, of foreknowledge, and of denunciation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that prophecy is unfittingly divided according to a 
gloss on Mt. 1:23, "Behold a virgin shall be with child," where it is 
stated that "one kind of prophecy proceeds from the Divine 
predestination, and must in all respects be accomplished so that its 
fulfillment is independent of our will, for instance the one in question. 
Another prophecy proceeds from God's foreknowledge: and into this our 
will enters. And another prophecy is called denunciation, which is 
significative of God's disapproval." For that which results from every 
prophecy should not be reckoned a part of prophecy. Now all prophecy is 
according to the Divine foreknowledge, since the prophets "read in the 
book of foreknowledge," as a gloss says on Is. 38:1. Therefore it would 
seem that prophecy according to foreknowledge should not be reckoned a 
species of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as something is foretold in denunciation, so is 
something foretold in promise, and both of these are subject to 
alteration. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++18:7,8">Jer. 18:7,8</a>): "I will suddenly speak 
against a nation and against a kingdom, to root out, and to pull down, 
and to destroy it. If that nation against which I have spoken shall 
repent of their evil, I also will repent"---and this pertains to the 
prophecy of denunciation, and afterwards the text continues in reference 
to the prophecy of promise (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++18:9,10">Jer. 18:9,10</a>): "I will suddenly speak of a 
nation and of a kingdom, to build up and plant it. If it shall do evil in 
My sight . . . I will repent of the good that I have spoken to do unto 
it." Therefore as there is reckoned to be a prophecy of denunciation, so 
should there be a prophecy of promise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. vii, 8): "There are seven kinds of 
prophecy. The first is an ecstasy, which is the transport of the mind: 
thus Peter saw a vessel descending from heaven with all manner of beasts 
therein. The second kind is a vision, as we read in Isaias, who says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++6:1">Is. 6:1</a>): 'I saw the Lord sitting,' etc. The third kind is a dream: thus 
Jacob in a dream, saw a ladder. The  fourth kind is from the midst of a 
cloud: thus God spake to Moses. The fifth kind is a voice from heaven, as 
that which called to Abraham saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++22:11">Gn. 22:11</a>): 'Lay not thy hand upon 
the boy.' The sixth kind is taking up a parable, as in the example of 
Balaam (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++23:7;+24:15">Num. 23:7; 24:15</a>). The seventh kind is the fullness of the Holy 
Ghost, as in the case of nearly all the prophets." Further, he mentions 
three kinds of vision; "one by the eyes of the body, another by the 
soul's imagination, a third by the eyes of the mind." Now these are not 
included in the aforesaid division. Therefore it is insufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Jerome to whom the gloss above 
quoted is ascribed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The species of moral habits and acts are distinguished 
according to their objects. Now the object of prophecy is something known 
by God and surpassing the faculty of man. Wherefore, according to the 
difference of such things, prophecy is divided into various species, as 
assigned above. Now it has been stated above (<A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71OUTP1">Question [71]</a>, <A Href="SS071.html#SSQ71A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>, ad 2) that the 
future is contained in the Divine knowledge in two ways. First, as in its 
cause: and thus we have the prophecy of "denunciation," which is not 
always fulfilled. but it foretells the relation of cause to effect, which 
is sometimes hindered by some other occurrence supervening. Secondly, God 
foreknows certain things in themselves---either as to be accomplished by 
Himself, and of such things is the prophecy of "predestination," since, 
according to Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 30), "God predestines things 
which are not in our power"---or as to be accomplished through man's 
free-will, and of such is the prophecy of "foreknowledge." This may 
regard either good or evil, which does not apply to the prophecy of 
predestination, since the latter regards good alone. And since 
predestination is comprised under foreknowledge, the gloss in the 
beginning of the Psalter assigns only two species to prophecy, namely of 
"foreknowledge," and of "denunciation."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Foreknowledge, properly speaking, denotes precognition of 
future events in themselves, and in this sense it is reckoned a species 
of prophecy. But in so far as it is used in connection with future 
events, whether as in themselves, or as in their causes, it is common to 
every species of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The prophecy of promise is included in the prophecy of 
denunciation, because the aspect of truth is the same in both. But it is 
denominated in preference from denunciation, because God is more inclined 
to remit punishment than to withdraw promised blessings.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Isidore divides prophecy according to the manner of 
prophesying. Now we may distinguish the manner of prophesying---either 
according to man's cognitive powers, which are sense, imagination, and 
intellect, and then we have the three kinds of vision mentioned both by 
him and by Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 6,7)---or according to the 
different ways in which the prophetic  current is received. Thus as 
regards the enlightening of the intellect there is the "fullness of the 
Holy Ghost" which he mentions in the seventh place. As to the imprinting 
of pictures on the imagination he mentions three, namely "dreams," to 
which he gives the third place; "vision," which occurs to the prophet 
while awake and regards any kind of ordinary object, and this he puts in 
the second place; and "ecstasy," which results from the mind being 
uplifted to certain lofty things, and to this he assigns the first place. 
As regards sensible signs he reckons three kinds of prophecy, because a 
sensible sign is---either a corporeal thing offered externally to the 
sight, such as "a cloud," which he mentions in the fourth place---or a 
"voice" sounding from without and conveyed to man's hearing---this he 
puts in the fifth place---or a voice proceeding from a man, conveying 
something under a similitude, and this pertains to the "parable" to which 
he assigns the sixth place.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the prophecy which is accompanied by intellective and imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by intellective vision alone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the prophecy which has intellective and 
imaginative vision is more excellent than that which is accompanied by 
intellective vision alone. For Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xii, 9): "He 
is less a prophet, who sees in spirit nothing but the signs 
representative of things, by means of the images of things corporeal: he 
is more a prophet, who is merely endowed with the understanding of these 
signs; but most of all is he a prophet, who excels in both ways," and 
this refers to the prophet who has intellective together with imaginative 
vision. Therefore this kind of prophecy is more excellent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater a thing's power is, the greater the distance 
to which it extends. Now the prophetic light pertains chiefly to the 
mind, as stated above (<A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173OUTP1">Question [173]</a>, <A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore apparently the prophecy 
that extends to the imagination is greater than that which is confined to 
the intellect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Jerome (Prol. in Lib. Reg.) distinguishes the "prophets" 
from the "sacred writers." Now all those whom he calls prophets (such as 
Isaias, Jeremias, and the like) had intellective together with 
imaginative vision: but not those whom he calls sacred writers, as 
writing by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost (such as Job, David, 
Solomon, and the like). Therefore it would seem more proper to call 
prophets those who had intellective together with imaginative vision, 
than those who had intellective vision alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. i) that "it is impossible 
for the Divine ray to shine on us, except as screened round about by the 
many-colored sacred veils." Now the prophetic revelation is conveyed by 
the infusion of the divine ray. Therefore it seems that it cannot be 
without the veils of phantasms. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss says at the beginning of the Psalter that "the 
most excellent manner of prophecy is when a man prophesies by the mere 
inspiration of the Holy Ghost, apart from any outward assistance of deed, 
word, vision, or dream."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The excellence of the means is measured chiefly by the 
end. Now the end of prophecy is the manifestation of a truth that 
surpasses the faculty of man. Wherefore the more effective this 
manifestation is, the more excellent the prophecy. But it is evident that 
the manifestation of divine truth by means of the bare contemplation of 
the truth itself, is more effective than that which is conveyed under the 
similitude of corporeal things, for it approaches nearer to the heavenly 
vision whereby the truth is seen in God's essence. Hence it follows that 
the prophecy whereby a supernatural truth is seen by intellectual vision, 
is more excellent than that in which a supernatural truth is manifested 
by means of the similitudes of corporeal things in the vision of the 
imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover the prophet's mind is shown thereby to be more lofty: even as 
in human teaching the hearer, who is able to grasp the bare intelligible 
truth the master propounds, is shown to have a better understanding than 
one who needs to be taken by the hand and helped by means of examples 
taken from objects of sense. Hence it is said in commendation of David's 
prophecy (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Sam++23:3">2 Kgs. 23:3</a>): "The strong one of Israel spoke to me," and 
further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Sam++23:4">2 Kgs. 23:4</a>): "As the light of the morning, when the sun 
riseth, shineth in the morning without clouds."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When a particular supernatural truth has to be revealed by 
means of corporeal images, he that has both, namely the intellectual 
light and the imaginary vision, is more a prophet than he that has only 
one, because his prophecy is more perfect; and it is in this sense that 
Augustine speaks as quoted above. Nevertheless the prophecy in which the 
bare intelligible truth is revealed is greater than all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same judgment does not apply to things that are sought 
for their own sake, as to things sought for the sake of something else. 
For in things sought for their own sake, the agent's power is the more 
effective according as it extends to more numerous and more remote 
objects; even so a physician is thought more of, if he is able to heal 
more people, and those who are further removed from health. on the other 
hand, in things sought only for the sake of something else, that agent 
would seem to have greater power, who is able to achieve his purpose with 
fewer means and those nearest to hand: thus more praise is awarded the 
physician who is able to heal a sick person by means of fewer and more 
gentle remedies. Now, in the prophetic knowledge, imaginary vision is 
required, not for its own sake, but on account of the manifestation of 
the intelligible truth. Wherefore prophecy is all the more excellent 
according as it needs it less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fact that a particular predicate is applicable to one 
thing and less properly to another, does not prevent this latter from 
being simply better than the former: thus the knowledge of the blessed is 
more excellent than the knowledge of the wayfarer, although faith is more 
properly predicated of the latter knowledge, because faith implies an 
imperfection of knowledge. In like manner prophecy implies a certain 
obscurity, and remoteness from the intelligible truth; wherefore the name 
of prophet is more properly applied to those who see by imaginary vision. 
And yet the more excellent prophecy is that which is conveyed by 
intellectual vision, provided the same truth be revealed in either case. 
If, however, the intellectual light be divinely infused in a person, not 
that he may know some supernatural things, but that he may be able to 
judge, with the certitude of divine truth, of things that can be known by 
human reason, such intellectual prophecy is beneath that which is 
conveyed by an imaginary vision leading to a supernatural truth. It was 
this kind of prophecy that all those had who are included in the ranks of 
the prophets, who moreover were called prophets for the special reason 
that they exercised the prophetic calling officially. Hence they spoke as 
God's representatives, saying to the people: "Thus saith the Lord": but 
not so the authors of the "sacred writings," several of whom treated more 
frequently of things that can be known by human reason, not in God's 
name, but in their own, yet with the assistance of the Divine light 
withal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the present life the enlightenment by the divine ray is 
not altogether without any veil of phantasms, because according to his 
present state of life it is unnatural to man not to understand without a 
phantasm. Sometimes, however, it is sufficient to have phantasms 
abstracted in the usual way from the senses without any imaginary vision 
divinely vouchsafed, and thus prophetic vision is said to be without 
imaginary vision.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the degrees of prophecy can be distinguished according to the imaginary vision?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of prophecy cannot be 
distinguished according to the imaginary vision. For the degrees of a 
thing bear relation to something that is on its own account, not on 
account of something else. Now, in prophecy, intellectual vision is 
sought on its own account, and imaginary vision on account of something 
else, as stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore it would seem that the 
degrees of prophecy are distinguished not according to imaginary, but 
only according to intellectual, vision.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly for one prophet there is one degree of 
prophecy. Now one prophet receives revelation through various imaginary 
visions. Therefore a difference of imaginary visions does not entail a 
difference of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to a gloss [*Cassiodorus, super Prolog. 
Hieron. in Psalt.], prophecy consists of words, deeds,  dreams, and 
visions. Therefore the degrees of prophecy should not be distinguished 
according to imaginary vision, to which vision and dreams pertain, rather 
than according to words and deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The medium differentiates the degrees of knowledge: 
thus science based on direct [*"Propter quid"] proofs is more excellent 
than science based on indirect [*"Quia"] premises or than opinion, 
because it comes through a more excellent medium. Now imaginary vision is 
a kind of medium in prophetic knowledge. Therefore the degrees of 
prophecy should be distinguished according to imaginary vision.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173OUTP1">Question [173]</a>, <A Href="SS173.html#SSQ173A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the prophecy wherein, by 
the intelligible light, a supernatural truth is revealed through an 
imaginary vision, holds the mean between the prophecy wherein a 
supernatural truth is revealed without imaginary vision, and that wherein 
through the intelligible light and without an imaginary vision, man is 
directed to know or do things pertaining to human conduct. Now knowledge 
is more proper to prophecy than is action; wherefore the lowest degree of 
prophecy is when a man, by an inward instinct, is moved to perform some 
outward action. Thus it is related of Samson (Judges 15:14) that "the 
Spirit of the Lord came strongly upon him, and as the flax [*'Lina.' St. 
Thomas apparently read 'ligna' ('wood')] is wont to be consumed at the 
approach of fire, so the bands with which he was bound were broken and 
loosed." The second degree of prophecy is when a man is enlightened by an 
inward light so as to know certain things, which, however, do not go 
beyond the bounds of natural knowledge: thus it is related of Solomon (3 
Kgs. 4:32,33) that "he spoke . . . parables . . . and he treated about 
trees from the cedar that is in Libanus unto the hyssop that cometh out 
of the wall, and he discoursed of beasts and of fowls, and of creeping 
things and of fishes": and all of this came from divine inspiration, for 
it was stated previously (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Kgs++4:29">3 Kgs. 4:29</a>): "God gave to Solomon wisdom and 
understanding exceeding much."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless these two degrees are beneath prophecy properly so called, 
because they do not attain to supernatural truth. The prophecy wherein 
supernatural truth is manifested through imaginary vision is 
differentiated first according to the difference between dreams which 
occur during sleep, and vision which occurs while one is awake. The 
latter belongs to a higher degree of prophecy, since the prophetic light 
that draws the soul away to supernatural things while it is awake and 
occupied with sensible things would seem to be stronger than that which 
finds a man's soul asleep and withdrawn from objects of sense. Secondly 
the degrees of this prophecy are differentiated according to the 
expressiveness of the imaginary signs whereby the intelligible truth is 
conveyed. And since words are the most expressive signs of intelligible 
truth, it would seem to be a higher degree of prophecy when the prophet, 
whether awake or asleep, hears words expressive of an intelligible truth, 
than when he sees things significative of truth, for instance "the seven 
full ears of corn" signified "seven years of plenty" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++41:22,26">Gn. 41:22,26</a>). In 
such like signs prophecy would seem to be the more  excellent, according 
as the signs are more expressive, for instance when Jeremias saw the 
burning of the city under the figure of a boiling cauldron (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++1:13">Jer. 1:13</a>). 
Thirdly, it is evidently a still higher degree of prophecy when a prophet 
not only sees signs of words or deeds, but also, either awake or asleep, 
sees someone speaking or showing something to him, since this proves the 
prophet's mind to have approached nearer to the cause of the revelation. 
Fourthly, the height of a degree of prophecy may be measured according to 
the appearance of the person seen: for it is a higher degree of prophecy, 
if he who speaks or shows something to the waking or sleeping prophet be 
seen by him under the form of an angel, than if he be seen by him under 
the form of man: and higher still is it, if he be seen by the prophet 
whether asleep or awake, under the appearance of God, according to Is. 
6:1, "I saw the Lord sitting."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But above all these degrees there is a third kind of prophecy, wherein 
an intelligible and supernatural truth is shown without any imaginary 
vision. However, this goes beyond the bounds of prophecy properly so 
called, as stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3); and consequently the degrees of 
prophecy are properly distinguished according to imaginary vision.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> We are unable to know how to distinguish the intellectual 
light, except by means of imaginary or sensible signs. Hence the 
difference in the intellectual light is gathered from the difference in 
the things presented to the imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1">Question [171]</a>, <A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), prophecy is by way, not of 
an abiding habit, but of a transitory passion; wherefore there is nothing 
inconsistent if one and the same prophet, at different times, receive 
various degrees of prophetic revelation.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The words and deeds mentioned there do not pertain to the 
prophetic revelation, but to the announcement, which is made according to 
the disposition of those to whom that which is revealed to the prophet is 
announced; and this is done sometimes by words, sometimes by deeds. Now 
this announcement, and the working of miracles, are something consequent 
upon prophecy, as stated above (<A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1">Question [171]</a>, <A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Moses was not the greatest of the prophets. 
For a gloss at the beginning of the Psalter says that "David is called 
the prophet by way of excellence." Therefore Moses was not the greatest 
of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, greater miracles were wrought by Josue, who made the sun 
and moon to stand still (Josue 10:12-14), and by Isaias, who made the sun 
to turn back (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++38:8">Is. 38:8</a>), than by Moses, who divided the Red Sea (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++14:21">Ex. 14:21</a>). In like manner greater miracles were wrought by Elias, of whom it 
is written (Ecclus.  48:4,5): "Who can glory like to thee? Who raisedst 
up a dead man from below." Therefore Moses was not the greatest of the 
prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:11">Mt. 11:11</a>) that "there hath not risen, 
among them that are born of women, a greater than John the Baptist." 
Therefore Moses was not greater than all the prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++34:10">Dt. 34:10</a>): "There arose no more a 
prophet in Israel like unto Moses."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Although in some respect one or other of the prophets was 
greater than Moses, yet Moses was simply the greatest of all. For, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171OUTP1">Question [171]</a>, <A Href="SS171.html#SSQ171A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), in prophecy we may consider not only 
the knowledge, whether by intellectual or by imaginary vision, but also 
the announcement and the confirmation by miracles. Accordingly Moses was 
greater than the other prophets. First, as regards the intellectual 
vision, since he saw God's very essence, even as Paul in his rapture did, 
according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xii, 27). Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++12:8">Num. 12:8</a>) that he saw God "plainly and not by riddles." Secondly, as regards 
the imaginary vision, which he had at his call, as it were, for not only 
did he hear words, but also saw one speaking to him under the form of 
God, and this not only while asleep, but even when he was awake. Hence it 
is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++33:11">Ex. 33:11</a>) that "the Lord spoke to Moses face to face, as a 
man is wont to speak to his friend." Thirdly, as regards the working of 
miracles which he wrought on a whole nation of unbelievers. Wherefore it 
is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++34:10,11">Dt. 34:10,11</a>): "There arose no more a prophet in Israel like 
unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face: in all the signs and 
wonders, which He sent by him, to do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and 
to all his servants, and to his whole land."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophecy of David approaches near to the vision of 
Moses, as regards the intellectual vision, because both received a 
revelation of intelligible and supernatural truth, without any imaginary 
vision. Yet the vision of Moses was more excellent as regards the 
knowledge of the Godhead; while David more fully knew and expressed the 
mysteries of Christ's incarnation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These signs of the prophets mentioned were greater as to 
the substance of the thing done; yet the miracles of Moses were greater 
as regards the way in which they were done, since they were wrought on a 
whole people.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> John belongs to the New Testament, whose ministers take 
precedence even of Moses, since they are spectators of a fuller 
revelation, as stated in 2 Cor. 3.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is a degree of prophecy in the blessed. 
For, as stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), Moses saw the Divine essence, and yet he is 
called a prophet. Therefore in like manner the  blessed can be called 
prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prophecy is a "divine revelation." Now divine 
revelations are made even to the blessed angels. Therefore even blessed 
angels can be prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ was a comprehensor from the moment of His 
conception; and yet He calls Himself a prophet (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++13:57">Mt. 13:57</a>), when He says: 
"A prophet is not without honor, save in his own country." Therefore even 
comprehensors and the blessed can be called prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written of Samuel (Ecclus. 46:23): "He lifted up 
his voice from the earth in prophecy to blot out the wickedness of the 
nation." Therefore other saints can likewise be called prophets after 
they have died.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The prophetic word is compared (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Pt++1:19">2 Pt. 1:19</a>) to a "light 
that shineth in a dark place." Now there is no darkness in the blessed. 
Therefore they cannot be called prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Prophecy denotes vision of some supernatural truth as 
being far remote from us. This happens in two ways. First, on the part of 
the knowledge itself, because, to wit, the supernatural truth is not 
known in itself, but in some of its effects; and this truth will be more 
remote if it be known by means of images of corporeal things, than if it 
be known in its intelligible effects; and such most of all is the 
prophetic vision, which is conveyed by images and likenesses of corporeal 
things. Secondly, vision is remote on the part of the seer, because, to 
wit, he has not yet attained completely to his ultimate perfection, 
according to 2 Cor. 5:6, "While we are in the body, we are absent from 
the Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now in neither of these ways are the blessed remote; wherefore they 
cannot be called prophets.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This vision of Moses was interrupted after the manner of a 
passion, and was not permanent like the beatific vision, wherefore he was 
as yet a seer from afar. For this reason his vision did not entirely lose 
the character of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The divine revelation is made to the angels, not as being 
far distant, but as already wholly united to God; wherefore their 
revelation has not the character of prophecy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ was at the same time comprehensor and wayfarer [*Cf. 
TP, Questions [9], seqq.]. Consequently the notion of prophecy is not applicable 
to Him as a comprehensor, but only as a wayfarer.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Samuel had not yet attained to the state of blessedness. 
Wherefore although by God's will the soul itself of Samuel foretold to 
Saul the issue of the war as revealed to him by God, this pertains to the 
nature of prophecy. It is not the same  with the saints who are now in 
heaven. Nor does it make any difference that this is stated to have been 
brought about by the demons' art, because although the demons are unable 
to evoke the soul of a saint, or to force it to do any particular thing, 
this can be done by the power of God, so that when the demon is 
consulted, God Himself declares the truth by His messenger: even as He 
gave a true answer by Elias to the King's messengers who were sent to 
consult the god of Accaron (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Kgs++1">4 Kgs. 1</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It might also be replied [*The Book of Ecclesiasticus was not as yet 
declared by the Church to be Canonical Scripture; Cf. FP, Question [89], Article [8], ad 
2] that it was not the soul of Samuel, but a demon impersonating him; and 
that the wise man calls him Samuel, and describes his prediction as 
prophetic, in accordance with the thoughts of Saul and the bystanders who 
were of this opinion.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of prophecy change as time goes 
on. For prophecy is directed to the knowledge of Divine things, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now according to Gregory (Hom. in Ezech.), "knowledge of 
God went on increasing as time went on." Therefore degrees of prophecy 
should be distinguished according to the process of time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, prophetic revelation is conveyed by God speaking to man; 
while the prophets declared both in words and in writing the things 
revealed to them. Now it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Sam++3:1">1 Kgs. 3:1</a>) that before the time of 
Samuel "the word of the Lord was precious," i.e. rare; and yet afterwards 
it was delivered to many. In like manner the books of the prophets do not 
appear to have been written before the time of Isaias, to whom it was 
said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++8:1">Is. 8:1</a>): "Take thee a great book and write in it with a man's 
pen," after which many prophets wrote their prophecies. Therefore it 
would seem that in course of time the degree of prophecy made progress.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:13">Mt. 11:13</a>): "The prophets and the law 
prophesied until John"; and afterwards the gift of prophecy was in 
Christ's disciples in a much more excellent manner than in the prophets 
of old, according to Eph. 3:5, "In other generations" the mystery of 
Christ "was not known to the sons of men, as it is now revealed to His 
holy apostles and prophets in the Spirit." Therefore it would seem that 
in course of time the degree of prophecy advanced.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), Moses was the greatest of the 
prophets, and yet he preceded the other prophets. Therefore prophecy did 
not advance in degree as time went on.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS174.html#SSQ174A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), prophecy is directed to the 
knowledge of Divine truth, by the contemplation of which we are not only 
instructed in faith, but also guided in our actions, according to Ps. 
42:3, "Send forth Thy light and Thy truth: they  have conducted me." Now 
our faith consists chiefly in two things: first, in the true knowledge of 
God, according to Heb. 11:6, "He that cometh to God must believe that He 
is"; secondly, in the mystery of Christ's incarnation, according to Jn. 
14:1, "You believe in God, believe also in Me." Accordingly, if we speak 
of prophecy as directed to the Godhead as its end, it progressed 
according to three divisions of time, namely before the law, under the 
law, and under grace. For before the law, Abraham and the other 
patriarchs were prophetically taught things pertinent to faith in the 
Godhead. Hence they are called prophets, according to Ps. 104:15, "Do no 
evil to My prophets," which words are said especially on behalf of 
Abraham and Isaac. Under the Law prophetic revelation of things pertinent 
to faith in the Godhead was made in a yet more excellent way than 
hitherto, because then not only certain special persons or families but 
the whole people had to be instructed in these matters. Hence the Lord 
said to Moses (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++6:2,3">Ex. 6:2,3</a>): "I am the Lord that appeared to Abraham, to 
Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God almighty, and My name Adonai I 
did not show to them"; because previously the patriarchs had been taught 
to believe in a general way in God, one and Almighty, while Moses was 
more fully instructed in the simplicity of the Divine essence, when it 
was said to him (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++3:14">Ex. 3:14</a>): "I am Who am"; and this name is signified by 
Jews in the word "Adonai" on account of their veneration for that 
unspeakable name. Afterwards in the time of grace the mystery of the 
Trinity was revealed by the Son of God Himself, according to Mt. 28:19: 
"Going . . . teach ye all nations, baptizing them in the name of the 
Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In each state, however, the most excellent revelation was that which was 
given first. Now the first revelation, before the Law, was given to 
Abraham, for it was at that time that men began to stray from faith in 
one God by turning aside to idolatry, whereas hitherto no such revelation 
was necessary while all persevered in the worship of one God. A less 
excellent revelation was made to Isaac, being founded on that which was 
made to Abraham. Wherefore it was said to him (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++26:24">Gn. 26:24</a>): "I am the God 
of Abraham thy father," and in like manner to Jacob (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++28:13">Gn. 28:13</a>): "I am 
the God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac." Again in the state 
of the Law the first revelation which was given to Moses was more 
excellent, and on this revelation all the other revelations to the 
prophets were founded. And so, too, in the time of grace the entire faith 
of the Church is founded on the revelation vouchsafed to the apostles, 
concerning the faith in one God and three Persons, according to Mt. 
16:18, "On this rock," i.e. of thy confession, "I will build My Church."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the faith in Christ's incarnation, it is evident that the nearer 
men were to Christ, whether before or after Him, the more fully, for the 
most part, were they instructed on this point, and after Him more fully 
than before, as the Apostle declares (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++3:5">Eph. 3:5</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the guidance of human acts, the prophetic  revelation varied 
not according to the course of time, but according as circumstances 
required, because as it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++29:18">Prov. 29:18</a>), "When prophecy shall 
fail, the people shall be scattered abroad." Wherefore at all times men 
were divinely instructed about what they were to do, according as it was 
expedient for the spiritual welfare of the elect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of Gregory is to be referred to the time before 
Christ's incarnation, as regards the knowledge of this mystery.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 27), "just as in the 
early days of the Assyrian kingdom promises were made most explicitly to 
Abraham, so at the outset of the western Babylon," which is Rome, "and 
under its sway Christ was to come, in Whom were to be fulfilled the 
promises made through the prophetic oracles testifying in word and 
writing to that great event to come," the promises, namely, which were 
made to Abraham. "For while prophets were scarcely ever lacking to the 
people of Israel from the time that they began to have kings, it was 
exclusively for their benefit, not for that of the nations. But when 
those prophetic writings were being set up with greater publicity, which 
at some future time were to benefit the nations, it was fitting to begin 
when this city," Rome to wit, "was being built, which was to govern the 
nations."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason why it behooved that nation to have a number of prophets 
especially at the time of the kings, was that then it was not over-ridden 
by other nations, but had its own king; wherefore it behooved the people, 
as enjoying liberty, to have prophets to teach them what to do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[174] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The prophets who foretold the coming of Christ could not 
continue further than John, who with his finger pointed to Christ 
actually present. Nevertheless as Jerome says on this passage, "This does 
not mean that there were no more prophets after John. For we read in the 
Acts of the apostles that Agabus and the four maidens, daughters of 
Philip, prophesied." John, too, wrote a prophetic book about the end of 
the Church; and at all times there have not been lacking persons having 
the spirit of prophecy, not indeed for the declaration of any new 
doctrine of faith, but for the direction of human acts. Thus Augustine 
says (De Civ. Dei v, 26) that "the emperor Theodosius sent to John who 
dwelt in the Egyptian desert, and whom he knew by his ever-increasing 
fame to be endowed with the prophetic spirit: and from him he received a 
message assuring him of victory."<br>
