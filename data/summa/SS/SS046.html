<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider folly which is opposed to wisdom; and under this 
head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ46A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether folly is contrary to wisdom?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ46A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether folly is a sin?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that folly is not contrary to wisdom. For seemingly 
unwisdom is directly opposed to wisdom. But folly does not seem to be the 
same as unwisdom, for the latter is apparently about Divine things alone, 
whereas folly is about both Divine and human things. Therefore folly is 
not contrary to wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one contrary is not the way to arrive at the other. But 
folly is the way to arrive at wisdom, for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++3:18">1 Cor. 3:18</a>): 
"If any man among you seem to be wise in this world, let him become a 
fool, that he may be wise." Therefore folly is not opposed to wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one contrary is not the cause of the other. But wisdom 
is the cause of folly; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jer++10:14">Jer. 10:14</a>): "Every man is 
become a fool for knowledge," and wisdom is a kind of knowledge. 
Moreover, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++47:10">Is. 47:10</a>): "Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, this 
hath deceived thee." Now it belongs to folly to be deceived. Therefore 
folly is not contrary to wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Isidore says (Etym. x, under the letter S) that "a fool 
is one whom shame does not incite to sorrow, and who is unconcerned when 
he is injured." But this pertains to spiritual wisdom, according to 
Gregory (Moral. x, 49). Therefore folly is not opposed to wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. ii, 26) that "the gift  of wisdom 
is given as a remedy against folly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Stultitia [Folly] seems to take its name from "stupor"; 
wherefore Isidore says (Etym. x, under the letter of S): "A fool is one 
who through dullness [stuporem] remains unmoved." And folly differs from 
fatuity, according to the same authority (Etym. x), in that folly implies 
apathy in the heart and dullness in the senses, while fatuity denotes 
entire privation of the spiritual sense. Therefore folly is fittingly 
opposed to wisdom.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For "sapiens" [wise] as Isidore says (Etym. x) "is so named from sapor 
[savor], because just as the taste is quick to distinguish between savors 
of meats, so is a wise man in discerning things and causes." Wherefore it 
is manifest that "folly" is opposed to "wisdom" as its contrary, while 
"fatuity" is opposed to it as a pure negation: since the fatuous man 
lacks the sense of judgment, while the fool has the sense, though dulled, 
whereas the wise man has the sense acute and penetrating.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Isidore (Etym. x), "unwisdom is contrary to 
wisdom because it lacks the savor of discretion and sense"; so that 
unwisdom is seemingly the same as folly. Yet a man would appear to be a 
fool chiefly through some deficiency in the verdict of that judgment, 
which is according to the highest cause, for if a man fails in judgment 
about some trivial matter, he is not for that reason called a fool.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as there is an evil wisdom, as stated above (<A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>, <A Href="SS045.html#SSQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1), called "worldly wisdom," because it takes for the highest 
cause and last end some worldly good, so too there is a good folly 
opposed to this evil wisdom, whereby man despises worldly things: and it 
is of this folly that the Apostle speaks.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is the wisdom of the world that deceives and makes us 
foolish in God's sight, as is evident from the Apostle's words (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++3:19">1 Cor. 3:19</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> To be unconcerned when one is injured is sometimes due to 
the fact that one has no taste for worldly things, but only for heavenly 
things. Hence this belongs not to worldly but to Divine wisdom, as 
Gregory declares (Moral. x, 49). Sometimes however it is the result of a 
man's being simply stupid about everything, as may be seen in idiots, who 
do not discern what is injurious to them, and this belongs to folly 
simply.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether folly is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that folly is not a sin. For no sin arises in us 
from nature. But some are fools naturally. Therefore folly is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Every sin is voluntary," according to Augustine (De 
Vera Relig. xiv). But folly is not voluntary.  Therefore it is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sin is contrary to a Divine precept. But folly is 
not contrary to any precept. Therefore folly is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++1:32">Prov. 1:32</a>): "The prosperity of fools 
shall destroy them." But no man is destroyed save for sin. Therefore 
folly is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Folly, as stated above (<A Href="SS046.html#SSQ46A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), denotes dullness of sense 
in judging, and chiefly as regards the highest cause, which is the last 
end and the sovereign good. Now a man may in this respect contract 
dullness in judgment in two ways. First, from a natural indisposition, as 
in the case of idiots, and such like folly is no sin. Secondly, by 
plunging his sense into earthly things, whereby his sense is rendered 
incapable of perceiving Divine things, according to 1 Cor. 2:14, "The 
sensual man perceiveth not these things that are of the Spirit of God," 
even as sweet things have no savor for a man whose taste is infected with 
an evil humor: and such like folly is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though no man wishes to be a fool, yet he wishes those 
things of which folly is a consequence, viz. to withdraw his sense from 
spiritual things and to plunge it into earthly things. The same thing 
happens in regard to other sins; for the lustful man desires pleasure, 
without which there is no sin, although he does not desire sin simply, 
for he would wish to enjoy the pleasure without sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Folly is opposed to the precepts about the contemplation of 
truth, of which we have spoken above (<A Href="SS016.html#SSQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>) when we were treating of 
knowledge and understanding.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether folly is a daughter of lust?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that folly is not a daughter of lust. For Gregory 
(Moral. xxxi, 45) enumerates the daughters of lust, among which however 
he makes no mention of folly. Therefore folly does not proceed from lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++3:19">1 Cor. 3:19</a>): "The wisdom of this 
world is foolishness with God." Now, according to Gregory (Moral. x, 29) 
"the wisdom of this world consists in covering the heart with crafty 
devices;" and this savors of duplicity. Therefore folly is a daughter of 
duplicity rather than of lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, anger especially is the cause of fury and madness in 
some persons; and this pertains to folly. Therefore folly arises from 
anger rather than from lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++7:22">Prov. 7:22</a>): "Immediately he  followeth 
her," i.e. the harlot . . . "not knowing that he is drawn like a fool to 
bonds."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As already stated (<A Href="SS046.html#SSQ46A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), folly, in so far as it is a 
sin, is caused by the spiritual sense being dulled, so as to be incapable 
of judging spiritual things. Now man's sense is plunged into earthly 
things chiefly by lust, which is about the greatest of pleasures; and 
these absorb the mind more than any others. Therefore the folly which is 
a sin, arises chiefly from lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is part of folly that a man should have a distaste for 
God and His gifts. Hence Gregory mentions two daughters of lust, 
pertaining to folly, namely, "hatred of God" and "despair of the life to 
come"; thus he divides folly into two parts as it were.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These words of the Apostle are to be understood, not 
causally but essentially, because, to wit, worldly wisdom itself is folly 
with God. Hence it does not follow that whatever belongs to worldly 
wisdom, is a cause of this folly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[46] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Anger by reason of its keenness, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS048.html#FSQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS048.html#FSQ48ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3,4), produces a great change in the nature of the body, 
wherefore it conduces very much to the folly which results from a bodily 
impediment. On the other hand the folly which is caused by a spiritual 
impediment, viz. by the mind being plunged into earthly things, arises 
chiefly from lust, as stated above.<br>
