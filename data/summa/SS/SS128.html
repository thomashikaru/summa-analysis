<H3 Align="Left">Whether the parts of fortitude are suitably assigned?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the parts of fortitude are unsuitably  assigned. 
For Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) assigns four parts to fortitude, namely 
"magnificence," "confidence," "patience," and "perseverance." Now 
magnificence seems to pertain to liberality; since both are concerned 
about money, and "a magnificent man must needs be liberal," as the 
Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 2). But liberality is a part of justice, 
as stated above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117OUTP1">Question [117]</a>, <A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore magnificence should not be 
reckoned a part of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, confidence is apparently the same as hope. But hope does 
not seem to pertain to fortitude, but is rather a virtue by itself. 
Therefore confidence should not be reckoned a part of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fortitude makes a man behave aright in face of danger. 
But magnificence and confidence do not essentially imply any relation to 
danger. Therefore they are not suitably reckoned as parts of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Tully (De Invent. Rhet. ii) patience 
denotes endurance of hardships, and he ascribes the same to fortitude. 
Therefore patience is the same as fortitude and not a part thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, that which is a requisite to every virtue should not be 
reckoned a part of a special virtue. But perseverance is required in 
every virtue: for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++24:13">Mt. 24:13</a>): "He that shall persevere to 
the end he shall be saved." Therefore perseverance should not be 
accounted a part of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, Macrobius (De Somn. Scip. i) reckons seven parts of 
fortitude, namely "magnanimity, confidence, security, magnificence, 
constancy, forbearance, stability." Andronicus also reckons seven virtues 
annexed to fortitude, and these are, "courage, strength of will, 
magnanimity, manliness, perseverance, magnificence." Therefore it seems 
that Tully's reckoning of the parts of fortitude is incomplete.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, Aristotle (Ethic. iii) reckons five parts of fortitude. 
The first is "civic" fortitude, which produces brave deeds through fear 
of dishonor or punishment; the second is "military" fortitude, which 
produces brave deeds as a result of warlike art or experience; the third 
is the fortitude which produces brave deeds resulting from passion, 
especially anger; the fourth is the fortitude which makes a man act 
bravely through being accustomed to overcome; the fifth is the fortitude 
which makes a man act bravely through being unaccustomed to danger. Now 
these kinds of fortitude are not comprised under any of the above 
enumerations. Therefore these enumerations of the parts of fortitude are 
unfitting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS048.html#SSQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>), a virtue can have three kinds of 
parts, subjective, integral, and potential. But fortitude, taken as a 
special virtue, cannot have subjective parts, since it is not divided 
into several specifically distinct virtues, for it  is about a very 
special matter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; However, there are quasi-integral and potential parts assigned to it: 
integral parts, with regard to those things the concurrence of which is 
requisite for an act of fortitude; and potential parts, because what 
fortitude practices in face of the greatest hardships, namely dangers of 
death, certain other virtues practice in the matter of certain minor 
hardships and these virtues are annexed to fortitude as secondary virtues 
to the principal virtue. As stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,6), the act of 
fortitude is twofold, aggression and endurance. Now two things are 
required for the act of aggression. The first regards preparation of the 
mind, and consists in one's having a mind ready for aggression. In this 
respect Tully mentions "confidence," of which he says (De Invent. Rhet. 
ii) that "with this the mind is much assured and firmly hopeful in great 
and honorable undertakings." The second regards the accomplishment of the 
deed, and consists in not failing to accomplish what one has confidently 
begun. In this respect Tully mentions "magnificence," which he describes 
as being "the discussion and administration," i.e. accomplishment "of 
great and lofty undertakings, with a certain broad and noble purpose of 
mind," so as to combine execution with greatness of purpose. Accordingly 
if these two be confined to the proper matter of fortitude, namely to 
dangers of death, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof, because 
without them there can be no fortitude; whereas if they be referred to 
other matters involving less hardship, they will be virtues specifically 
distinct from fortitude, but annexed thereto as secondary virtues to 
principal: thus "magnificence" is referred by the Philosopher (Ethic. iv) 
to great expenses, and "magnanimity," which seems to be the same as 
confidence, to great honors. Again, two things are requisite for the 
other act of fortitude, viz. endurance. The first is that the mind be not 
broken by sorrow, and fall away from its greatness, by reason of the 
stress of threatening evil. In this respect he mentions "patience," which 
he describes as "the voluntary and prolonged endurance of arduous and 
difficult things for the sake of virtue or profit." The other is that by 
the prolonged suffering of hardships man be not wearied so as to lose 
courage, according to Heb. 12:3, "That you be not wearied, fainting in 
your minds." In this respect he mentions "perseverance," which 
accordingly he describes as "the fixed and continued persistence in a 
well considered purpose." If these two be confined to the proper matter 
of fortitude, they will be quasi-integral parts thereof; but if they be 
referred to any kind of hardship they will be virtues distinct from 
fortitude, yet annexed thereto as secondary to principal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Magnificence in the matter of liberality adds a certain 
greatness: this is connected with the notion of difficulty which is the 
object of the irascible faculty, that is perfected chiefly by fortitude: 
and to this virtue, in this respect, it belongs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hope whereby one confides in God is accounted a theological 
virtue, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS062.html#FSQ62A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But by  
confidence which here is accounted a part of fortitude, man hopes in 
himself, yet under God withal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To venture on anything great seems to involve danger, since 
to fail in such things is very disastrous. Wherefore although 
magnificence and confidence are referred to the accomplishment of or 
venturing on any other great things, they have a certain connection with 
fortitude by reason of the imminent danger.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Patience endures not only dangers of death, with which 
fortitude is concerned, without excessive sorrow, but also any other 
hardships or dangers. In this respect it is accounted a virtue annexed to 
fortitude: but as referred to dangers of death, it is an integral part 
thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Perseverance as denoting persistence in a good deed unto 
the end, may be a circumstance of every virtue, but it is reckoned a part 
of fortitude in the sense stated in the body of the Article.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Macrobius reckons the four aforesaid mentioned by Tully, 
namely "confidence, magnificence, forbearance," which he puts in the 
place of patience, and "firmness," which he substitutes for perseverance. 
And he adds three, two of which, namely "magnanimity" and "security," are 
comprised by Tully under the head of confidence. But Macrobius is more 
specific in his enumeration. Because confidence denotes a man's hope for 
great things: and hope for anything presupposes an appetite stretching 
forth to great things by desire, and this belongs to magnanimity. For it 
has been stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) that hope presupposes love and 
desire of the thing hoped for.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A still better reply is that confidence pertains to the certitude of 
hope; while magnanimity refers to the magnitude of the thing hoped for. 
Now hope has no firmness unless its contrary be removed, for sometimes 
one, for one's own part, would hope for something, but hope is avoided on 
account of the obstacle of fear, since fear is somewhat contrary to hope, 
as stated above, (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 1). Hence Macrobius adds security, 
which banishes fear. He adds a third, namely constancy, which may be 
comprised under magnificence. For in performing deeds of magnificence one 
needs to have a constant mind. For this reason Tully says that 
magnificence consists not only in accomplishing great things, but also in 
discussing them generously in the mind. Constancy may also pertain to 
perseverance, so that one may be called persevering through not desisting 
on account of delays, and constant through not desisting on account of 
any other obstacles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Those that are mentioned by Andronicus seem to amount to the same as the 
above. For with Tully and Macrobius he mentions "perseverance" and 
"magnificence," and with Macrobius, "magnanimity." "Strength of will" is 
the same as patience or forbearance, for he says that "strength of will 
is a habit that  makes one ready to attempt what ought to be attempted, 
and to endure what reason says should be endured"---i.e. good courage 
seems to be the same as assurance, for he defines it as "strength of soul 
in the accomplishment of its purpose." Manliness is apparently the same 
as confidence, for he says that "manliness is a habit of self-sufficiency 
in matters of virtue." Besides magnificence he mentions {andragathia}, 
i.e. manly goodness which we may render "strenuousness." For magnificence 
consists not only in being constant in the accomplishment of great deeds, 
which belongs to constancy, but also in bringing a certain manly prudence 
and solicitude to that accomplishment, and this belongs to {andragathia}, 
strenuousness: wherefore he says that {andragathia} is the virtue of a 
man, whereby he thinks out profitable works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly it is evident that all these parts may be reduced to the 
four principal parts mentioned by Tully.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[128] A[1] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> The five mentioned by Aristotle fall short of the true 
notion of virtue, for though they concur in the act of fortitude, they 
differ as to motive, as stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2); wherefore they 
are not reckoned parts but modes of fortitude.<br>
