THE SERVICE OF THE BODY (Question [84])<br>
<br>
OF ADORATION (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In due sequence we must consider the external acts of latria, and in the 
first place, adoration whereby one uses one's body to reverence God; 
secondly, those acts whereby some external thing is offered to God; 
thirdly, those acts whereby something belonging to God is assumed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are three points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ84A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether adoration is an act of latria?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ84A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether adoration denotes an internal or an external act?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ84A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether adoration requires a definite place?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that adoration is not an act of latria or religion. 
The worship of religion is due to God alone. But adoration is not due to 
God alone: since we read (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++18:2">Gn. 18:2</a>) that Abraham adored the angels; and 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Kgs++1:23">3 Kgs. 1:23</a>) that the prophet Nathan, when he was come in to king David, 
"worshiped him bowing down to the ground." Therefore adoration is not an 
act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the worship of religion is due to God as the object of 
beatitude, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei x, 3): whereas adoration 
is due to Him by reason of His majesty, since a gloss on Ps. 28:2, "Adore 
ye the Lord in His holy court," says: "We  pass from these courts into 
the court where we adore His majesty." Therefore adoration is not an act 
of latria.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the worship of one same religion is due to the three 
Persons. But we do not adore the three Persons with one adoration, for we 
genuflect at each separate invocation of Them [*At the adoration of the 
Cross, on Good Friday]. Therefore adoration is nol an act of latria.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> are the words quoted Mt. 4:10: "The Lord thy God shalt 
thou adore and Him only shalt thou serve."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Adoration is directed to the reverence of the person 
adored. Now it is evident from what we have said (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,4) that it 
is proper to religion to show reverence to God. Hence the adoration 
whereby we adore God is an act of religion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Reverence is due to God on account of His excellence, which 
is communicated to certain creatures not in equal measure, but according 
to a measure of proportion; and so the reverence which we pay to God, and 
which belongs to latria, differs from the reverence which we pay to 
certain excellent creatures; this belongs to dulia, and we shall speak of 
it further on (<A Href="SS103.html#SSQ103OUTP1">Question [103]</a>). And since external actions are signs of internal 
reverence, certain external tokens significative of reverence are offered 
to creatures of excellence, and among these tokens the chief is 
adoration: yet there is one thing which is offered to God alone, and that 
is sacrifice. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 4): "Many tokens of 
Divine worship are employed in doing honor to men, either through 
excessive humility, or through pernicious flattery; yet so that those to 
whom these honors are given are recognized as being men to whom we owe 
esteem and reverence and even adoration if they be far above us. But who 
ever thought it his duty to sacrifice to any other than one whom he 
either knew or deemed or pretended to be a God?" Accordingly it was with 
the reverence due to an excellent creature that Nathan adored David; 
while it was the reverence due to God with which Mardochai refused to 
adore Aman fearing "lest he should transfer the honor of his God to a 
man" (Esther 13:14).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again with the reverence due to an excellent creature Abraham adored the 
angels, as did also Josue (Jos. 5:15): though we may understand them to 
have adored, with the adoration of latria, God Who appeared and spoke to 
them in the guise of an angel. It was with the reverence due to God that 
John was forbidden to adore the angel (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rev+++22:9">Apoc. 22:9</a>), both to indicate the 
dignity which he had acquired through Christ, whereby man is made equal 
to an angel: wherefore the same text goes on: "I am thy fellow-servant 
and of thy brethren"; as also to exclude any occasion of idolatry, 
wherefore the text continues: "Adore God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every Divine excellency is included in His majesty: to 
which it pertains that we should be made happy in Him as in the sovereign 
good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Since there is one excellence of the three Divine Persons, 
one honor and reverence is due to them and consequently one adoration. It 
is to represent this that where it is related (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++18:2">Gn. 18:2</a>) that three men 
appeared to Abraham, we are told that he addressed one, saying: "Lord, if 
I have found favor in thy sight," etc. The triple genuflection represents 
the Trinity of Persons, not a difference of adoration.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether adoration denotes an action of the body?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that adoration does not denote an act of the body. 
It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++4:23">Jn. 4:23</a>): "The true adorers shall adore the Father in 
spirit and in truth." Now what is done in spirit has nothing to do with 
an act of the body. Therefore adoration does not denote an act of the 
body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the word adoration is taken from "oratio" [prayer]. But 
prayer consists chiefly in an interior act, according to 1 Cor. 14:15, "I 
will pray with the spirit, I will pray also with the understanding." 
Therefore adoration denotes chiefly a spiritual act.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, acts of the body pertain to sensible knowledge: whereas 
we approach God not by bodily but by spiritual sense. Therefore adoration 
does not denote an act of the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Ex. 20:5, "Thou shalt not adore them, nor 
serve them," says: "Thou shalt neither worship them in mind, nor adore 
them outwardly."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv, 12), since we are 
composed of a twofold nature, intellectual and sensible, we offer God a 
twofold adoration; namely, a spiritual adoration, consisting in the 
internal devotion of the mind; and a bodily adoration, which consists in 
an exterior humbling of the body. And since in all acts of latria that 
which is without is referred to that which is within as being of greater 
import, it follows that exterior adoration is offered on account of 
interior adoration, in other words we exhibit signs of humility in our 
bodies in order to incite our affections to submit to God, since it is 
connatural to us to proceed from the sensible to the intelligible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even bodily adoration is done in spirit, in so far as it 
proceeds from and is directed to spiritual devotion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as prayer is primarily in the mind, and secondarily 
expressed in words, as stated above (<A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83OUTP1">Question [83]</a>, <A Href="SS083.html#SSQ83A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>), so too adoration 
consists chiefly in an interior reverence of God, but secondarily in 
certain bodily signs of humility; thus when we genuflect we signify our 
weakness in comparison with God, and when we prostrate ourselves we 
profess that we are nothing of ourselves.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Though we cannot reach God with the senses, our  mind is 
urged by sensible signs to approach God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether adoration requires a definite place?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that adoration does not require a definite place. 
It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++4:21">Jn. 4:21</a>): "The hour cometh, when you shall neither on 
this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, adore the Father"; and the same reason 
seems to apply to other places. Therefore a definite place is not 
necessary for adoration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, exterior adoration is directed to interior adoration. 
But interior adoration is shown to God as existing everywhere. Therefore 
exterior adoration does not require a definite place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the same God is adored in the New as in the Old 
Testament. Now in the Old Testament they adored towards the west, because 
the door of the Tabernacle looked to the east (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++26:18+seqq+">Ex. 26:18 seqq.</a>). 
Therefore for the same reason we ought now to adore towards the west, if 
any definite place be requisite for adoration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++56:7">Is. 56:7</a>): "My house shall be called the 
house of prayer," which words are also quoted (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++2:16">Jn. 2:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS084.html#SSQ84A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the chief part of adoration is 
the internal devotion of the mind, while the secondary part is something 
external pertaining to bodily signs. Now the mind internally apprehends 
God as not comprised in a place; while bodily signs must of necessity be 
in some definite place and position. Hence a definite place is required 
for adoration, not chiefly, as though it were essential thereto, but by 
reason of a certain fittingness, like other bodily signs.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By these words our Lord foretold the cessation of 
adoration, both according to the rite of the Jews who adored in 
Jerusalem, and according to the rite of the Samaritans who adored on 
Mount Garizim. For both these rites ceased with the advent of the 
spiritual truth of the Gospel, according to which "a sacrifice is offered 
to God in every place," as stated in Malach. 1:11.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A definite place is chosen for adoration, not on account of 
God Who is adored, as though He were enclosed in a place, but on account 
of the adorers; and this for three reasons. First, because the place is 
consecrated, so that those who pray there conceive a greater devotion and 
are more likely to be heard, as may be seen in the prayer of Solomon (3 
Kgs. 8). Secondly, on account of the sacred mysteries and other signs of 
holiness contained therein. Thirdly, on account of the concourse of many 
adorers, by reason of which their prayer is more likely to be heard, 
according to Mt. 18:20, "Where there are two or three gathered together 
in My name, there am I in the midst of them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[84] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is a certain fittingness in adoring towards the east. 
First, because the Divine majesty is indicated in the movement of the 
heavens which is from the east. Secondly, because Paradise was situated 
in the east according to the Septuagint version of Gn. 2:8, and so we 
signify our desire to return to Paradise. Thirdly, on account of Christ 
Who is "the light of the world" [*Jn. 8:12; 9:5], and is called "the 
Orient" (Zach. 6:12). Who mounteth above the heaven of heavens to the 
east (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++67:34">Ps. 67:34</a>), and is expected to come from the east, according to Mt. 
24:27, "As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth even into the 
west; so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be."<br>
