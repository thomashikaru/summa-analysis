are four points of inquiry:<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men are not bound by precept to make 
oblations. Men are not bound, at the time of the Gospel, to observe the 
ceremonial precepts of the Old Law, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS103.html#FSQ103OUTP1">Question [103]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS103.html#FSQ103ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). Now the offering of oblations is one of the ceremonial precepts of 
the Old Law, since it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++23:14">Ex. 23:14</a>): "Three times every year you 
shall celebrate feasts with Me," and further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++23:15">Ex. 23:15</a>): "Thou shalt 
not appear empty before Me." Therefore  men are not now under a necessity 
of precept to make oblations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, before they are made, oblations depend on man's will, as 
appears from our Lord's saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++5:23">Mt. 5:23</a>), "If . . . thou offer thy gift 
at the altar," as though this were left to the choice of the offerer: and 
when once oblations have been made, there is no way of offering them 
again. Therefore in no way is a man under a necessity of precept to make 
oblations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if anyone is bound to give a certain thing to the 
Church, and fails to give it, he can be compelled to do so by being 
deprived of the Church's sacraments. But it would seem unlawful to refuse 
the sacraments of the Church to those who refuse to make oblations 
according to a decree of the sixth council [*Can. Trullan, xxiii], quoted 
I, qu. i, can. Nullus: "Let none who dispense Holy Communion exact 
anything of the recipient, and if they exact anything let them be 
deposed." Therefore it is not necessary that men should make oblations.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says [*Gregory VII; Concil. Roman. v, can. 
xii]: "Let every Christian take care that he offer something to God at 
the celebration of Mass."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3), the term "oblation" 
is common to all things offered for the Divine worship, so that if a 
thing be offered to be destroyed in worship of God, as though it were 
being made into something holy, it is both an oblation and a sacrifice. 
Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++29:18">Ex. 29:18</a>): "Thou shalt offer the whole ram for 
a burnt-offering upon the altar; it is an oblation to the Lord, a most 
sweet savor of the victim of the Lord"; and (Lev. 2:1): "When anyone 
shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to the Lord, his offering shall be 
of fine flour." If, on the other hand, it be offered with a view to its 
remaining entire and being deputed to the worship of God or to the use of 
His ministers, it will be an oblation and not a sacrifice. Accordingly it 
is essential to oblations of this kind that they be offered voluntarily, 
according to Ex. 25:2, of "every man that offereth of his own accord you 
shall take them." Nevertheless it may happen in four ways that one is 
bound to make oblations. First, on account of a previous agreement: as 
when a person is granted a portion of Church land, that he may make 
certain oblations at fixed times, although this has the character of 
rent. Secondly, by reason of a previous assignment or promise; as when a 
man offers a gift among the living, or by will bequeaths to the Church 
something whether movable or immovable to be delivered at some future 
time. Thirdly, on account of the need of the Church, for instance if her 
ministers were without means of support. Fourthly, on account of custom; 
for the faithful are bound at certain solemn feasts to make certain 
customary oblations. In the last two cases, however, the oblation remains 
voluntary, as regards, to wit, the quantity or kind of the thing offered.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Under the New Law men are not bound to make oblations on 
account of legal solemnities, as stated in Exodus, but  on account of 
certain other reasons, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some are bound to make oblations, both before making them, 
as in the first, third, and. fourth cases, and after they have made them 
by assignment or promise: for they are bound to offer in reality that 
which has been already offered to the Church by way of assignment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Those who do not make the oblations they are bound to make 
may be punished by being deprived of the sacraments, not by the priest 
himself to whom the oblations should be made, lest he seem to exact, 
something for bestowing the sacraments, but by someone superior to him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether oblations are due to priests alone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that oblations are not due to priests alone. For 
chief among oblations would seem to be those that are deputed to the 
sacrifices of victims. Now whatever is given to the poor is called a 
"victim in Scripture according to Heb. 13:16, "Do not forget to do good 
and to impart, for by such victims [Douay: 'sacrifices'] God's favor is 
obtained. Much more therefore are oblations due to the poor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in many parishes monks have a share in the oblations. 
Now "the case of clerics is distinct from the case of monks," as Jerome 
states [*Ep. xiv, ad Heliod.]. Therefore oblations art not due to priests 
alone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, lay people with the consent of the Church buy oblations 
such as loaves and so forth, and they do so for no other reason than that 
they may make use thereof themselves. Therefore oblations may have 
reference to the laity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A canon of Pope Damasus [*Damasus I] quoted X, qu. i 
[*Can. Hanc consuetudinem], says: "None but the priests whom day by day 
we see serving the Lord may eat and drink of the oblations which are 
offered within the precincts of the Holy Church: because in the Old 
Testament the Lord forbade the children of Israel to eat the sacred 
loaves, with the exception of Aaron and his sons" (Lev. 24:8,9).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The priest is appointed mediator and stands, so to speak, 
"between" the people and God, as we read of Moses (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++5:5">Dt. 5:5</a>), wherefore it 
belongs to him to set forth the Divine teachings and sacraments before 
the people; and besides to offer to the Lord things appertaining to the 
people, their prayers, for instance, their sacrifices and oblations. Thus 
the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++5:1">Heb. 5:1</a>): "Every high priest taken from among men is 
ordained for men in the things that appertain to God, that he may offer 
up gifts and sacrifices for sins." Hence the oblations which the people 
offer to God concern the priests, not only as regards their turning them 
to their own use, but also as regards the faithful dispensation  thereof, 
by spending them partly on things appertaining to the Divine worship, 
partly on things touching their own livelihood (since they that serve the 
altar partake with the altar, according to 1 Cor. 9:13), and partly for 
the good of the poor, who, as far as possible, should be supported from 
the possessions of the Church: for our Lord had a purse for the use of 
the poor, as Jerome observes on Mt. 17:26, "That we may not scandalize 
them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Whatever is given to the poor is not a sacrifice properly 
speaking; yet it is called a sacrifice in so far as it is given to them 
for God's sake. In like manner, and for the same reason, it can be called 
an oblation, though not properly speaking, since it is not given 
immediately to God. Oblations properly so called fall to the use of the 
poor, not by the dispensation of the offerers, but by the dispensation of 
the priests.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Monks or other religious may receive oblations under three 
counts. First, as poor, either by the dispensation of the priests, or by 
ordination of the Church; secondly, through being ministers of the altar, 
and then they can accept oblations that are freely offered; thirdly, if 
the parishes belong to them, and they can accept oblations, having a 
right to them as rectors of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Oblations when once they are consecrated, such as sacred 
vessels and vestments, cannot be granted to the use of the laity: and 
this is the meaning of the words of Pope Damasus. But those which are 
unconsecrated may be allowed to the use of layfolk by permission of the 
priests, whether by way of gift or by way of sale.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man may make oblations of whatever he lawfully possesses?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man may not make oblations of whatever he 
lawfully possesses. According to human law [*Dig. xii, v, de Condict. ob. 
turp. vel iniust. caus. 4] "the whore's is a shameful trade in what she 
does but not in what she takes," and consequently what she takes she 
possesses lawfully. Yet it is not lawful for her to make an oblation with 
her gains, according to Dt. 23:18, "Thou shalt not offer the hire of a 
strumpet . . . in the house of the Lord thy God." Therefore it is not 
lawful to make an oblation of whatever one possesses lawfully.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the same passage it is forbidden to offer "the price 
of a dog" in the house of God. But it is evident that a man possesses 
lawfully the price of a dog he has lawfully sold. Therefore it is not 
lawful to make an oblation of whatever we possess lawfully.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Malachi+1:8">Malachi 1:8</a>): "If you offer the lame and 
the sick, is it not evil?" Yet an animal though lame or sick is a lawful 
possession. Therefore it would seem that not of every lawful possession 
may one make an oblation. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++3:9">Prov. 3:9</a>): "Honor the Lord with thy 
substance." Now whatever a man possesses lawfully belongs to his 
substance. Therefore he may make oblations of whatever he possesses 
lawfully.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Verb. Dom. Serm. cxiii), "shouldst 
thou plunder one weaker than thyself and give some of the spoil to the 
judge, if he should pronounce in thy favor, such is the force of justice 
that even thou wouldst not be pleased with him: and if this should not 
please thee, neither does it please thy God." Hence it is written 
(Ecclus. 34:21): "The offering of him that sacrificeth of a thing 
wrongfully gotten is stained." Therefore it is evident that an oblation 
must not be made of things unjustly acquired or possessed. In the Old 
Law, however, wherein the figure was predominant, certain things were 
reckoned unclean on account of their signification, and it was forbidden 
to offer them. But in the New Law all God's creatures are looked upon as 
clean, as stated in Titus 1:15: and consequently anything that is 
lawfully possessed, considered in itself, may be offered in oblation. But 
it may happen accidentally that one may not make an oblation of what one 
possesses lawfully; for instance if it be detrimental to another person, 
as in the case of a son who offers to God the means of supporting his 
father (which our Lord condemns, Mt. 15:5), or if it give rise to scandal 
or contempt, or the like.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the Old Law it was forbidden to make an offering of the 
hire of a strumpet on account of its uncleanness, and in the New Law, on 
account of scandal, lest the Church seem to favor sin if she accept 
oblations from the profits of sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Law, a dog was deemed an unclean animal. 
Yet other unclean animals were redeemed and their price could be offered, 
according to Lev. 27:27, "If it be an unclean animal, he that offereth it 
shall redeem it." But a dog was neither offered nor redeemed, both 
because idolaters used dogs in sacrifices to their idols, and because 
they signify robbery, the proceeds of which cannot be offered in 
oblation. However, this prohibition ceased under the New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The oblation of a blind or lame animal was declared 
unlawful for three reasons. First, on account of the purpose for which it 
was offered, wherefore it is written (Malach. 1:8): "If you offer the 
blind in sacrifice, is it not evil?" and it behooved sacrifices to be 
without blemish. Secondly, on account of contempt, wherefore the same 
text goes on (Malach. 1:12): "You have profaned" My name, "in that you 
say: The table of the Lord is defiled and that which is laid thereupon is 
contemptible." Thirdly, on account of a previous vow, whereby a man has 
bound himself to offer without blemish whatever he has vowed: hence the 
same text says further on (Malach. 1:14): "Cursed is the deceitful man 
that hath in his flock a male, and making a vow offereth in sacrifice 
that which is feeble to the Lord." The same reasons avail still in the 
New Law, but when they do not apply the unlawfulness ceases.

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men are not bound to pay first-fruits. After 
giving the law of the first-born the text continues (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++13:9">Ex. 13:9</a>): "It shall 
be as a sign in thy hand," so that, apparently, it is a ceremonial 
precept. But ceremonial precepts are not to be observed in the New Law. 
Neither therefore ought first-fruits to be paid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, first-fruits were offered to the Lord for a special 
favor conferred on that people, wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++26:2,3">Dt. 26:2,3</a>): 
"Thou shalt take the first of all thy fruits . . . and thou shalt go to 
the priest that shall be in those days, and say to him: I profess this 
day before the Lord thy God, that I am come into the land, for which He 
swore to our fathers, that He would give it us." Therefore other nations 
are not bound to pay first-fruits.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> That which one is bound to do should be something definite. But 
neither in the New Law nor in the Old do we find mention of a definite 
amount of first-fruits. Therefore one is not bound of necessity to pay 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is laid down (16, qu. vii, can. Decimas): "We 
confirm the right of priests to tithes and first-fruits, and everybody 
must pay them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> First-fruits are a kind of oblation, because they are 
offered to God with a certain profession (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++26">Dt. 26</a>); where the same passage 
continues: "The priest taking the basket containing the first-fruits from 
the hand of him that bringeth the first-fruits, shall set it before the 
altar of the Lord thy God," and further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++26:10">Dt. 26:10</a>) he is commanded to 
say: "Therefore now I offer the first-fruits of the land, which the Lord 
hath given me." Now the first-fruits were offered for a special reason, 
namely, in recognition of the divine favor, as though man acknowledged 
that he had received the fruits of the earth from God, and that he ought 
to offer something to God in return, according to 1 Paral 29:14, "We have 
given Thee what we received of Thy hand." And since what we offer God 
ought to be something special, hence it is that man was commanded to 
offer God his first-fruits, as being a special part of the fruits of the 
earth: and since a priest is "ordained for the people "in the things that 
appertain to God" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++5:1">Heb. 5:1</a>), the first-fruits offered by the people were 
granted to the priest's use." Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++18:8">Num. 18:8</a>): "The 
Lord said to Aaron: Behold I have given thee the charge of My 
first-fruits." Now it is a point of natural law that man should make an 
offering in God's honor out of the things he has received from God, but 
that the offering should be made to any particular person, or out of his 
first-fruits, or in such or such a quantity, was indeed determined in the 
Old Law by divine command; but in the New Law it is fixed by the 
declaration of the Church, in virtue of which men are bound to pay 
first-fruits according to the custom of  their country and the needs of

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The ceremonial observances were properly speaking signs of 
the future, and consequently they ceased when the foreshadowed truth was 
actually present. But the offering of first-fruits was for a sign of a 
past favor, whence arises the duty of acknowledgment in accordance with 
the dictate of natural reason. Hence taken in a general sense this 
obligation remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> First-fruits were offered in the Old Law, not only on 
account of the favor of the promised land given by God, but also on 
account of the favor of the fruits of the earth, which were given by God. 
Hence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++26:10">Dt. 26:10</a>): "I offer the first-fruits of the land 
which the Lord hath given me," which second motive is common among all 
people. We may also reply that just as God granted the land of promise to 
the Jews by a special favor, so by a general favor He bestowed the 
lordship of the earth on the whole of mankind, according to Ps. 113:24, 
"The earth He has given to the children of men."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[86] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Jerome says [*Comment. in Ezech. 45:13,14; cf. Cap. 
Decimam, de Decim. Primit. et Oblat.]: "According to the tradition of the 
ancients the custom arose for those who had most to give the priests a 
fortieth part, and those who had least, one sixtieth, in lieu of 
first-fruits." Hence it would seem that first-fruits should vary between 
these limits according to the custom of one's country. And it was 
reasonable that the amount of first-fruits should not be fixed by law, 
since, as stated above, first-fruits are offered by way of oblation, a 
condition of which is that it should be voluntary.<br>
