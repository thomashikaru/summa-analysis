</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vices contrary to peace, which belong to deeds: 
such are schism, strife, sedition, and war. In the first place, then, 
about schism, there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ39A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether schism is a special sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ39A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is graver than unbelief?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ39A3THEP1">(3)</a> Of the power exercised by schismatics;
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ39A4THEP1">(4)</a> Of the punishment inflicted on them.

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that schism is not a special sin. For "schism," as 
Pope Pelagius I says (Epist. ad Victor. et Pancrat.), "denotes a 
division." But every sin causes a division, according to Is. 59:: "Your 
sins have divided between you and your God." Therefore schism is not a 
special sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man is apparently a schismatic if he disobeys the 
Church. But every sin makes a man disobey the commandments of the Church, 
because sin, according to Ambrose (De Parad. viii) "is disobedience 
against the heavenly commandments." Therefore every sin is a schism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, heresy also divides a man from the unity of faith. If, 
therefore, the word schism denotes a division, it would seem not to 
differ, as a special sin, from the sin of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine (Contra Faust. xx, 3; Contra Crescon. ii, 4) 
distinguishes between schism and heresy, for he says that a "schismatic 
is one who holds the same faith, and practises the same worship, as 
others, and takes pleasure in the mere disunion of the community, whereas 
a heretic is one who holds another faith from that of the Catholic 
Church." Therefore schism is not a generic sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Isidore says (Etym. viii, 3), schism takes its name 
"from being a scission of minds," and scission is opposed to unity. 
Wherefore the sin of schism is one that is directly and essentially 
opposed to unity. For in the moral, as in the physical order, the species 
is not constituted by that which is accidental. Now, in the moral order, 
the essential is that which is intended, and that which results beside 
the intention, is, as it were, accidental. Hence the sin of schism is, 
properly speaking, a special sin, for the reason that the schismatic 
intends to sever himself from that unity which is the effect of charity: 
because charity unites not only one person to another with the bond of 
spiritual love, but also the whole Church in unity of spirit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly schismatics properly so called are those who, wilfully and 
intentionally separate themselves from the unity of the Church; for this 
is the chief unity, and the particular unity of several individuals among 
themselves is subordinate to the unity of the Church, even as the mutual 
adaptation of each member of a  natural body is subordinate to the unity 
of the whole body. Now the unity of the Church consists in two things; 
namely, in the mutual connection or communion of the members of the 
Church, and again in the subordination of all the members of the Church 
to the one head, according to Col. 2:18,19: "Puffed up by the sense of 
his flesh, and not holding the Head, from which the whole body, by joints 
and bands, being supplied with nourishment and compacted, groweth unto 
the increase of God." Now this Head is Christ Himself, Whose viceregent 
in the Church is the Sovereign Pontiff. Wherefore schismatics are those 
who refuse to submit to the Sovereign Pontiff, and to hold communion with 
those members of the Church who acknowledge his supremacy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The division between man and God that results from sin is 
not intended by the sinner: it happens beside his intention as a result 
of his turning inordinately to a mutable good, and so it is not schism 
properly so called.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The essence of schism consists in rebelliously disobeying 
the commandments: and I say "rebelliously," since a schismatic both 
obstinately scorns the commandments of the Church, and refuses to submit 
to her judgment. But every sinner does not do this, wherefore not every 
sin is a schism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Heresy and schism are distinguished in respect of those 
things to which each is opposed essentially and directly. For heresy is 
essentially opposed to faith, while schism is essentially opposed to the 
unity of ecclesiastical charity. Wherefore just as faith and charity are 
different virtues, although whoever lacks faith lacks charity, so too 
schism and heresy are different vices, although whoever is a heretic is 
also a schismatic, but not conversely. This is what Jerome says in his 
commentary on the Epistle to the Galatians [*In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10]: "I 
consider the difference between schism and heresy to be that heresy holds 
false doctrine while schism severs a man from the Church." Nevertheless, 
just as the loss of charity is the road to the loss of faith, according 
to 1 Tim. 1:6: "From which things," i.e. charity and the like, "some 
going astray, are turned aside into vain babbling," so too, schism is the 
road to heresy. Wherefore Jerome adds (In Ep. ad Tit. iii, 10) that "at 
the outset it is possible, in a certain respect, to find a difference 
between schism and heresy: yet there is no schism that does not devise 
some heresy for itself, that it may appear to have had a reason for 
separating from the Church."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether schism is a graver sin than unbelief?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that schism is a graver sin than unbelief. For the 
graver sin meets with a graver punishment, according to Dt. 25:2: 
"According to the measure of the sin shall the measure also of the 
stripes be." Now we find the sin of schism punished more severely than 
even the sin of unbelief or idolatry: for we read (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++32:28">Ex. 32:28</a>) that some 
were slain by the swords of their fellow men on account of idolatry: 
whereas of the sin of schism we  read (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++16:30">Num. 16:30</a>): "If the Lord do a new 
thing, and the earth opening her mouth swallow them down, and all things 
that belong to them, and they go down alive into hell, you shall know 
that they have blasphemed the Lord God." Moreover the ten tribes who were 
guilty of schism in revolting from the rule of David were most severely 
punished (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?2+Kgs++17">4 Kgs. 17</a>). Therefore the sin of schism is graver than the sin 
of unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "The good of the multitude is greater and more godlike 
than the good of the individual," as the Philosopher states (Ethic. i, 
2). Now schism is opposed to the good of the multitude, namely, 
ecclesiastical unity, whereas unbelief is contrary to the particular good 
of one man, namely the faith of an individual. Therefore it seems that 
schism is a graver sin than unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a greater good is opposed to a greater evil, according 
to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 10). Now schism is opposed to charity, 
which is a greater virtue than faith to which unbelief is opposed, as 
shown above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="SS023.html#SSQ23A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Therefore schism is a graver sin 
than unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which results from an addition to something else 
surpasses that thing either in good or in evil. Now heresy results from 
something being added to schism, for it adds corrupt doctrine, as Jerome 
declares in the passage quoted above (<A Href="SS039.html#SSQ39A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3). Therefore schism is a 
less grievous sin than unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The gravity of a sin can be considered in two ways: 
first, according to the species of that sin, secondly, according to its 
circumstances. And since particular circumstances are infinite in number, 
so too they can be varied in an infinite number of ways: wherefore if one 
were to ask in general which of two sins is the graver, the question must 
be understood to refer to the gravity derived from the sin's genus. Now 
the genus or species of a sin is taken from its object, as shown above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72OUTP1">Question [72]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS072.html#FSQ72A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Wherefore the sin which is opposed to 
the greater good is, in respect of its genus, more grievous, for instance 
a sin committed against God is graver than a sin committed against one's 
neighbor.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it is evident that unbelief is a sin committed against God Himself, 
according as He is Himself the First Truth, on which faith is founded; 
whereas schism is opposed to ecclesiastical unity, which is a 
participated good, and a lesser good than God Himself. Wherefore it is 
manifest that the sin of unbelief is generically more grievous than the 
sin of schism, although it may happen that a particular schismatic sins 
more grievously than a particular unbeliever, either because his contempt 
is greater, or because his sin is a source of greater danger, or for some 
similar reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It had already been declared to that people by the law 
which they had received that there was one God, and that no other God was 
to be worshipped by them; and the same had been confirmed among them by 
many kinds of signs. Consequently there was  no need for those who sinned 
against this faith by falling into idolatry, to be punished in an 
unwonted manner: it was enough that they should be punished in the usual 
way. On the other hand, it was not so well known among them that Moses 
was always to be their ruler, and so it behooved those who rebelled 
against his authority to be punished in a miraculous and unwonted manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also reply by saying that the sin of schism was sometimes more 
severely punished in that people, because they were inclined to seditions 
and schisms. For it is written (1 Esdra 4:15): "This city since days gone 
by has rebelled against its kings: and seditions and wars were raised 
therein [*Vulg.: 'This city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to the 
kings and provinces, and . . . wars were raised therein of old']." Now 
sometimes a more severe punishment is inflicted for an habitual sin (as 
stated above, FS, Question [105], Article [2], ad 9), because punishments are medicines 
intended to keep man away from sin: so that where there is greater 
proneness to sin, a more severe punishment ought to be inflicted. As 
regards the ten tribes, they were punished not only for the sin of 
schism, but also for that of idolatry as stated in the passage quoted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the good of the multitude is greater than the good 
of a unit in that multitude, so is it less than the extrinsic good to 
which that multitude is directed, even as the good of a rank in the army 
is less than the good of the commander-in-chief. In like manner the good 
of ecclesiastical unity, to which schism is opposed, is less than the 
good of Divine truth, to which unbelief is opposed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Charity has two objects; one is its principal object and is 
the Divine goodness, the other is its secondary object and is our 
neighbor's good. Now schism and other sins against our neighbor, are 
opposed to charity in respect of its secondary good, which is less than 
the object of faith, for this is God Himself; and so these sins are less 
grievous than unbelief. On the other hand, hatred of God, which is 
opposed to charity in respect of its principal object, is not less 
grievous than unbelief. Nevertheless of all sins committed by man against 
his neighbor, the sin of schism would seem to be the greatest, because it 
is opposed to the spiritual good of the multitude.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether schismatics have any power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that schismatics have some power. For Augustine 
says (Contra Donat. i, 1): "Just as those who come back to the Church 
after being baptized, are not baptized again, so those who return after 
being ordained, are not ordained again." Now Order is a kind of power. 
Therefore schismatics have some power since they retain their Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Unico Bapt. [*De Bap. contra Donat. 
vi, 5]): "One who is separated can confer a sacrament  even as he can 
have it." But the power of conferring a sacrament is a very great power. 
Therefore schismatics who are separated from the Church, have a spiritual 
power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Pope Urban II [*Council of Piacenza, cap. x; cf. Can. 
Ordinationes, ix, qu. 1] says: "We command that persons consecrated by 
bishops who were themselves consecrated according to the Catholic rite, 
but have separated themselves by schism from the Roman Church, should be 
received mercifully and that their Orders should be acknowledged, when 
they return to the unity of the Church, provided they be of commendable 
life and knowledge." But this would not be so, unless spiritual power 
were retained by schismatics. Therefore schismatics have spiritual power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Cyprian says in a letter (Ep. lii, quoted vii, qu. 1, 
can. Novatianus): "He who observes neither unity of spirit nor the 
concord of peace, and severs himself from the bonds of the Church, and 
from the fellowship of her priests, cannot have episcopal power or honor."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Spiritual power is twofold, the one sacramental, the 
other a power of jurisdiction. The sacramental power is one that is 
conferred by some kind of consecration. Now all the consecrations of the 
Church are immovable so long as the consecrated thing remains: as appears 
even in inanimate things, since an altar, once consecrated, is not 
consecrated again unless it has been broken up. Consequently such a power 
as this remains, as to its essence, in the man who has received it by 
consecration, as long as he lives, even if he fall into schism or heresy: 
and this is proved from the fact that if he come back to the Church, he 
is not consecrated anew. Since, however, the lower power ought not to 
exercise its act, except in so far as it is moved by the higher power, as 
may be seen also in the physical order, it follows that such persons lose 
the use of their power, so that it is not lawful for them to use it. Yet 
if they use it, this power has its effect in sacramental acts, because 
therein man acts only as God's instrument, so that sacramental effects 
are not precluded on account of any fault whatever in the person who 
confers the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the power of jurisdiction is that which is conferred 
by a mere human appointment. Such a power as this does not adhere to the 
recipient immovably: so that it does not remain in heretics and 
schismatics; and consequently they neither absolve nor excommunicate, nor 
grant indulgence, nor do anything of the kind, and if they do, it is 
invalid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly when it is said that such like persons have no spiritual 
power, it is to be understood as referring either to the second power, or 
if it be referred to the first power, not as referring to the essence of 
the power, but to its lawful use.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that schismatics are not rightly punished with 
excommunication. For excommunication deprives a man chiefly of a share in 
the sacraments. But Augustine says (Contra Donat. vi, 5) that "Baptism 
can be received from a schismatic." Therefore it seems that 
excommunication is not a fitting punishment for schismatics.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is the duty of Christ's faithful to lead back those 
who have gone astray, wherefore it is written against certain persons 
(Ezech. 34:4): "That which was driven away you have not brought again, 
neither have you sought that which was lost." Now schismatics are more 
easily brought back by such as may hold communion with them. Therefore it 
seems that they ought not to be excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a double punishment is not inflicted for one and the 
same sin, according to Nahum 1:9: "God will not judge the same twice" 
[*Septuagint version]. Now some receive a temporal punishment for the sin 
of schism, according to Question [23], Article [5], where it is stated: "Both divine and 
earthly laws have laid down that those who are severed from the unity of 
the Church, and disturb her peace, must be punished by the secular 
power." Therefore they ought not to be punished with excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++16:26">Num. 16:26</a>): "Depart from the tents of 
these wicked men," those, to wit, who had caused the schism, "and touch 
nothing of theirs, lest you be involved in their sins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to Wis. 11:11, "By what things a man sinneth, 
by the same also he should be punished" [Vulg.: 'he is tormented']. Now a 
schismatic, as shown above (<A Href="SS039.html#SSQ39A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), commits a twofold sin: first by 
separating himself from communion with the members of the Church, and in 
this respect the fitting punishment for schismatics is that they be 
excommunicated. Secondly, they refuse submission to the head of the 
Church, wherefore, since they are unwilling to be controlled by the 
Church's spiritual power, it is just that they should be compelled by the 
secular power.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not lawful to receive Baptism from a schismatic, save 
in a case of necessity, since it is better for a man to quit this life, 
marked with the sign of Christ, no matter from whom he may receive it, 
whether from a Jew or a pagan, than deprived of that mark, which is 
bestowed in Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Excommunication does not forbid the intercourse whereby a 
person by salutary admonitions leads back to the unity of the Church 
those who are separated from her. Indeed this very separation brings them 
back somewhat, because through confusion at their separation, they are 
sometimes led to do penance 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[39] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The punishments of the present life are medicinal, and 
therefore when one punishment does not suffice to compel a man, another 
is added: just as physicians employ several body medicines when one has 
no effect. In like manner the Church, when excommunication does not 
sufficiently restrain certain men, employs the compulsion of the secular 
arm. If, however, one punishment suffices, another should not be employed.<br>
