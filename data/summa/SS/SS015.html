<H3 Align="Center">OF THE VICES OPPOSED TO KNOWLEDGE AND UNDERSTANDING (THREE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the vices opposed to knowledge and understanding. 
Since, however, we have treated of ignorance which is opposed to 
knowledge, when we were discussing the causes of sins (FS, Question [76]), we 
must now inquire about blindness of mind and dulness of sense, which are 
opposed to the gift of understanding; and under this head there are three 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ15A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether blindness of mind is a sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ15A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether dulness of sense is a sin distinct from blindness of mind?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ15A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether these vices arise from sins of the flesh?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that blindness of mind is not a sin. Because, 
seemingly, that which excuses from sin is not itself a sin. Now blindness 
of mind excuses from sin; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++9:41">Jn. 9:41</a>): "If you were 
blind, you should not have sin." Therefore blindness of mind is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, punishment differs from guilt. But blindness of mind is 
a punishment as appears from Is. 6:10, "Blind the heart of this people," 
for, since it is an evil, it could not be from God, were it not a 
punishment. Therefore blindness of mind is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sin is voluntary, according to Augustine (De Vera 
Relig. xiv). Now blindness of mind is not voluntary, since, as Augustine 
says (Confess. x), "all love to know the resplendent truth," and as we 
read in Eccles. 11:7, "the light is sweet and it is delightful for the 
eyes to see the sun." Therefore blindness of mind is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons blindness of mind 
among the vices arising from lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as bodily blindness is the privation of the 
principle of bodily sight, so blindness of mind is the privation of the 
principle of mental or intellectual sight. Now this has a threefold 
principle. One is the light of natural reason,  which light, since it 
pertains to the species of the rational soul, is never forfeit from the 
soul, and yet, at times, it is prevented from exercising its proper act, 
through being hindered by the lower powers which the human intellect 
needs in order to understand, for instance in the case of imbeciles and 
madmen, as stated in the FP, Question [84], Articles [7],8.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another principle of intellectual sight is a certain habitual light 
superadded to the natural light of reason, which light is sometimes 
forfeit from the soul. This privation is blindness, and is a punishment, 
in so far as the privation of the light of grace is a punishment. Hence 
it is written concerning some (Wis. 2:21): "Their own malice blinded 
them."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; A third principle of intellectual sight is an intelligible principle, 
through which a man understands other things; to which principle a man 
may attend or not attend. That he does not attend thereto happens in two 
ways. Sometimes it is due to the fact that a man's will is deliberately 
turned away from the consideration of that principle, according to Ps. 
35:4, "He would not understand, that he might do well": whereas sometimes 
it is due to the mind being more busy about things which it loves more, 
so as to be hindered thereby from considering this principle, according 
to Ps. 57:9, "Fire," i.e. of concupiscence, "hath fallen on them and they 
shall not see the sun." In either of these ways blindness of mind is a 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The blindness that excuses from sin is that which arises 
from the natural defect of one who cannot see.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument considers the second kind of blindness which 
is a punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To understand the truth is, in itself, beloved by all; and 
yet, accidentally it may be hateful to someone, in so far as a man is 
hindered thereby from having what he loves yet more.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether dulness of sense is a sin distinct from blindness of mind?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that dulness of sense is not a distinct sin from 
blindness of mind. Because one thing has one contrary. Now dulness is 
opposed to the gift of understanding, according to Gregory (Moral. ii, 
49); and so is blindness of mind, since understanding denotes a principle 
of sight. Therefore dulness of sense is the same as blindness of mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) in speaking of dulness 
describes it as "dullness of sense in respect of understanding." Now 
dulness of sense in respect of understanding seems to be the same as a 
defect in understanding, which pertains to blindness of mind. Therefore 
dulness of sense is the same as blindness of mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if they differ at all, it seems to be chiefly in the 
fact that blindness of mind is voluntary, as stated above (<A Href="SS015.html#SSQ15A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), while 
dulness of sense is a natural defect. But a natural defect is not a sin: 
so that, accordingly, dulness of sense would not be a sin, which is 
contrary to what Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 45), where he reckons it 
among the sins arising from gluttony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Different causes produce different effects. Now Gregory 
says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that dulness of sense arises from gluttony, and 
that blindness of mind arises from lust. Now these others are different 
vices. Therefore those are different vices also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Dull is opposed to sharp: and a thing is said to be sharp 
because it can pierce; so that a thing is called dull through being 
obtuse and unable to pierce. Now a bodily sense, by a kind of metaphor, 
is said to pierce the medium, in so far as it perceives its object from a 
distance or is able by penetration as it were to perceive the smallest 
details or the inmost parts of a thing. Hence in corporeal things the 
senses are said to be acute when they can perceive a sensible object from 
afar, by sight, hearing, or scent, while on the other hand they are said 
to be dull, through being unable to perceive, except sensible objects 
that are near at hand, or of great power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, by way of similitude to bodily sense, we speak of sense in 
connection with the intellect; and this latter sense is in respect of 
certain primals and extremes, as stated in Ethic. vi, even as the senses 
are cognizant of sensible objects as of certain principles of knowledge. 
Now this sense which is connected with understanding, does not perceive 
its object through a medium of corporeal distance, but through certain 
other media, as, for instance, when it perceives a thing's essence 
through a property thereof, and the cause through its effect. 
Consequently a man is said to have an acute sense in connection with his 
understanding, if, as soon as he apprehends a property or effect of a 
thing, he understands the nature or the thing itself, and if he can 
succeed in perceiving its slightest details: whereas a man is said to 
have a dull sense in connection with his understanding, if he cannot 
arrive at knowing the truth about a thing, without many explanations; in 
which case, moreover, he is unable to obtain a perfect perception of 
everything pertaining to the nature of that thing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly dulness of sense in connection with understanding denotes a 
certain weakness of the mind as to the consideration of spiritual goods; 
while blindness of mind implies the complete privation of the knowledge 
of such things. Both are opposed to the gift of understanding, whereby a 
man knows spiritual goods by apprehending them, and has a subtle 
penetration of their inmost nature. This dulness has the character of 
sin, just as blindness of mind has, that is, in so far as it is 
voluntary, as evidenced in one who, owing to his affection for carnal 
things, dislikes or neglects the careful consideration of spiritual 
things.

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether blindness of mind and dulness of sense arise from sins of the flesh?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that blindness of mind and dulness of sense do not 
arise from sins of the flesh. For Augustine (Retract. i, 4) retracts what 
he had said in his Soliloquies i, 1, "God Who didst wish none but the 
clean to know the truth," and says that one might reply that "many, even 
those who are unclean, know many truths." Now men become unclean chiefly 
by sins of the flesh. Therefore blindness of mind and dulness of sense 
are not caused by sins of the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, blindness of mind and dulness of sense are defects in 
connection with the intellective part of the soul: whereas carnal sins 
pertain to the corruption of the flesh. But the flesh does not act on the 
soul, but rather the reverse. Therefore the sins of the flesh do not 
cause blindness of mind and dulness of sense.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all things are more passive to what is near them than to 
what is remote. Now spiritual vices are nearer the mind than carnal vices 
are. Therefore blindness of mind and dulness of sense are caused by 
spiritual rather than by carnal vices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that dulness of sense 
arises from gluttony and blindness of mind from lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The perfect intellectual operation in man consists in an 
abstraction from sensible phantasms, wherefore the more a man's intellect 
is freed from those phantasms, the more thoroughly will it be able to 
consider things intelligible, and to set in order all things sensible. 
Thus Anaxagoras stated that the intellect requires to be "detached" in 
order to command, and that the agent must have power over matter, in 
order to be able to move it. Now it is evident that pleasure fixes a 
man's attention on that which he takes pleasure in: wherefore the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. x, 4,5) that we all do best that which we take 
pleasure in doing, while as to other things, we do them either not at 
all, or in a faint-hearted fashion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now carnal vices, namely gluttony and lust, are concerned with pleasures 
of touch in matters of food and sex; and these are the most impetuous of 
all pleasures of the body. For this reason these vices cause man's 
attention to be very firmly fixed on corporeal things, so that in 
consequence man's operation in regard to intelligible things is weakened, 
more, however, by lust than by gluttony, forasmuch as sexual pleasures 
are more vehement than those of the table. Wherefore lust gives rise to 
blindness of mind, which excludes almost entirely the knowledge of 
spiritual things, while dulness of sense arises from gluttony, which 
makes a man weak  in regard to the same intelligible things. On the other 
hand, the contrary virtues, viz. abstinence and chastity, dispose man 
very much to the perfection of intellectual operation. Hence it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dan++1:17">Dan. 1:17</a>) that "to these children" on account of their 
abstinence and continency, "God gave knowledge and understanding in every 
book, and wisdom."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although some who are the slaves of carnal vices are at 
times capable of subtle considerations about intelligible things, on 
account of the perfection of their natural genius, or of some habit 
superadded thereto, nevertheless, on account of the pleasures of the 
body, it must needs happen that their attention is frequently withdrawn 
from this subtle contemplation: wherefore the unclean can know some 
truths, but their uncleanness is a clog on their knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The flesh acts on the intellective faculties, not by 
altering them, but by impeding their operation in the aforesaid manner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[15] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is owing to the fact that the carnal vices are further 
removed from the mind, that they distract the mind's attention to more 
remote things, so that they hinder the mind's contemplation all the more.<br>
