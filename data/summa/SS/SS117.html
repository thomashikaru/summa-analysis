</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not a virtue. For no virtue is 
contrary to a natural inclination. Now it is a natural inclination for 
one to provide for oneself more than for others: and yet it pertains to 
the liberal man to do the contrary, since, according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. iv, 1), "it is the mark of a liberal man not to look to himself, 
so that he leaves for himself the lesser things." Therefore liberality is 
not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man sustains life by means of riches, and wealth 
contributes to happiness instrumentally, as stated in Ethic. i, 8. Since, 
then, every virtue is directed to happiness, it seems that the liberal 
man is not virtuous, for the Philosopher says of him (Ethic. iv, 1) that 
"he is inclined neither to receive nor to keep money, but to give it 
away."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the virtues are connected with one another. But 
liberality does not seem to be connected with the other virtues: since 
many are virtuous who cannot be liberal, for they have nothing to give; 
and many give or spend liberally who are not virtuous otherwise. 
Therefore liberality is not a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that "the Gospel contains 
many instances in which a just liberality is inculcated." Now in the 
Gospel nothing is taught that does not pertain to virtue. Therefore 
liberality is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19), "it belongs to 
virtue to use well the things that we can use ill." Now we may use both 
well and ill, not only the things that are within  us, such as the powers 
and the passions of the soul, but also those that are without, such as 
the things of this world that are granted us for our livelihood. 
Wherefore since it belongs to liberality to use these things well, it 
follows that liberality is a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Ambrose (Serm. lxiv de Temp.) and Basil (Hom. 
in Luc. xii, 18) excess of riches is granted by God to some, in order 
that they may obtain the merit of a good stewardship. But it suffices for 
one man to have few things. Wherefore the liberal man commendably spends 
more on others than on himself. Nevertheless we are bound to be more 
provident for ourselves in spiritual goods, in which each one is able to 
look after himself in the first place. And yet it does not belong to the 
liberal man even in temporal things to attend so much to others as to 
lose sight of himself and those belonging to him. Wherefore Ambrose says 
(De Offic. i): "It is a commendable liberality not to neglect your 
relatives if you know them to be in want."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It does not belong to a liberal man so to give away his 
riches that nothing is left for his own support, nor the wherewithal to 
perform those acts of virtue whereby happiness is acquired. Hence the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "the liberal man does not neglect 
his own, wishing thus to be of help to certain people"; and Ambrose says 
(De Offic. i) that "Our Lord does not wish a man to pour out his riches 
all at once, but to dispense them: unless he do as Eliseus did, who slew 
his oxen and fed the poor, that he might not be bound by any household 
cares." For this belongs to the state of perfection, of which we shall 
speak farther on (<A Href="SS184.html#SSQ184OUTP1">Question [184]</a>, <A Href="SS186.html#SSQ186OUTP1">Question [186]</a>, <A Href="SS186.html#SSQ186A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It must be observed, however, that the very act of giving away one's 
possessions liberally, in so far as it is an act of virtue, is directed 
to happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1), "those who spend 
much on intemperance are not liberal but prodigal"; and likewise whoever 
spends what he has for the sake of other sins. Hence Ambrose says (De 
Offic. i): "If you assist to rob others of their possessions, your 
honesty is not to be commended, nor is your liberality genuine if you 
give for the sake of boasting rather than of pity." Wherefore those who 
lack other virtues, though they spend much on certain evil works, are not 
liberal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, nothing hinders certain people from spending much on good uses, 
without having the habit of liberality: even as men perform works of 
other virtues, before having the habit of virtue, though not in the same 
way as virtuous people, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS065.html#FSQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). In like manner 
nothing prevents a virtuous man from being liberal, although he be poor. 
Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "Liberality is proportionate 
to a man's substance," i.e. his means, "for it consists, not in the 
quantity given, but in the habit of the giver": and Ambrose says (De 
Offic. i) that "it is the heart that makes a gift rich or poor, and gives 
things their value."

<H3 Align="Left">Whether liberality is about money?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not about money. For every moral 
virtue is about operations and passions. Now it is proper to justice to 
be about operations, as stated in Ethic. v, 1. Therefore, since 
liberality is a moral virtue, it seems that it is about passions and not 
about money.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to a liberal man to make use of any kind of 
wealth. Now natural riches are more real than artificial riches, 
according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 5,6). Therefore liberality is not 
chiefly about money.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, different virtues have different matter, since habits 
are distinguished by their objects. But external things are the matter of 
distributive and commutative justice. Therefore they are not the matter 
of liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "liberality 
seems to be a mean in the matter of money."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1) it belongs to 
the liberal man to part with things. Hence liberality is also called 
open-handedness [largitas], because that which is open does not withhold 
things but parts of them. The term "liberality" seems also to allude to 
this, since when a man quits hold of a thing he frees it [liberat], so to 
speak, from his keeping and ownership, and shows his mind to be free of 
attachment thereto. Now those things which are the subject of a man's 
free-handedness towards others are the goods he possesses, which are 
denoted by the term "money." Therefore the proper matter of liberality is 
money.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), liberality depends not on the 
quantity given, but on the heart of the giver. Now the heart of the giver 
is disposed according to the passions of love and desire, and 
consequently those of pleasure and sorrow, towards the things given. 
Hence the interior passions are the immediate matter of liberality, while 
exterior money is the object of those same passions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says in his book De Disciplina Christi (Tract. 
de divers, i), everything whatsoever man has on earth, and whatsoever he 
owns, goes by the name of "'pecunia' [money], because in olden times 
men's possessions consisted entirely of 'pecora' [flocks]." And the 
Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "We give the name of money to anything 
that can be valued in currency."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Justice establishes equality in external things, but has 
nothing to do, properly speaking, with the regulation of internal 
passions: wherefore money is in one way the matter of liberality, and in 
another way of justice.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether using money is the act of liberality?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that using money is not the act of liberality. For 
different virtues have different acts. But using money is becoming to 
other virtues, such as justice and magnificence. Therefore it is not the 
proper act of liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it belongs to a liberal man, not only to give but also 
to receive and keep. But receiving and keeping do not seem to be 
connected with the use of money. Therefore using money seems to be 
unsuitably assigned as the proper act of liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the use of money consists not only in giving it but also 
in spending it. But the spending of money refers to the spender, and 
consequently is not an act of liberality: for Seneca says (De Benef. v): 
"A man is not liberal by giving to himself." Therefore not every use of 
money belongs to liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1): "In whatever 
matter a man is virtuous, he will make the best use of that matter: 
Therefore he that has the virtue with regard to money will make the best 
use of riches." Now such is the liberal man. Therefore the good use of 
money is the act of liberality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The species of an act is taken from its object, as stated 
above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now the object or matter of liberality is money 
and whatever has a money value, as stated in the foregoing Article (ad 
2). And since every virtue is consistent with its object, it follows 
that, since liberality is a virtue, its act is consistent with money. Now 
money comes under the head of useful goods, since all external goods are 
directed to man's use. Hence the proper act of liberality is making use 
of money or riches.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to liberality to make good use of riches as 
such, because riches are the proper matter of liberality. On the other 
hand it belongs to justice to make use of riches under another aspect, 
namely, that of debt, in so far as an external thing is due to another. 
And it belongs to magnificence to make use of riches under a special 
aspect, in so far, to wit, as they are employed for the fulfilment of 
some great deed. Hence magnificence stands in relation to liberality as 
something in addition thereto, as we shall explain farther on (<A Href="SS134.html#SSQ134OUTP1">Question [134]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to a virtuous man not only to make good use of 
his matter or instrument, but also to provide opportunities for that good 
use. Thus it belongs to a soldier's fortitude not only to wield his sword 
against the foe, but also to sharpen his sword and keep it in its sheath. 
Thus, too, it belongs to liberality not only to use money, but also to 
keep it in preparation and safety in order to make fitting use of it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), the internal passions  whereby man 
is affected towards money are the proximate matter of liberality. Hence 
it belongs to liberality before all that a man should not be prevented 
from making any due use of money through an inordinate affection for it. 
Now there is a twofold use of money: one consists in applying it to one's 
own use, and would seem to come under the designation of costs or 
expenditure; while the other consists in devoting it to the use of 
others, and comes under the head of gifts. Hence it belongs to liberality 
that one be not hindered by an immoderate love of money, either from 
spending it becomingly, or from making suitable gifts. Therefore 
liberality is concerned with giving and spending, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1). The saying of Seneca refers to liberality as 
regards giving: for a man is not said to be liberal for the reason that 
he gives something to himself.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it belongs to a liberal man chiefly to give?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it does not belong to a liberal man chiefly to 
give. For liberality, like all other moral virtues, is regulated by 
prudence. Now it seems to belong very much to prudence that a man should 
keep his riches. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that 
"those who have not earned money, but have received the money earned by 
others, spend it more liberally, because they have not experienced the 
want of it." Therefore it seems that giving does not chiefly belong to 
the liberal man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no man is sorry for what he intends chiefly to do, nor 
does he cease from doing it. But a liberal man is sometimes sorry for 
what he has given, nor does he give to all, as stated in Ethic. iv, 1. 
Therefore it does not belong chiefly to a liberal man to give.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in order to accomplish what he intends chiefly, a man 
employs all the ways he can. Now a liberal man is not a beggar, as the 
Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv, 1); and yet by begging he might provide 
himself with the means of giving to others. Therefore it seems that he 
does not chiefly aim at giving.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man is bound to look after himself rather than others. 
But by spending he looks after himself, whereas by giving he looks after 
others. Therefore it belongs to a liberal man to spend rather than to 
give.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "it belongs to 
a liberal man to surpass in giving."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is proper to a liberal man to use money. Now the use 
of money consists in parting with it. For the acquisition of money is 
like generation rather than use: while the keeping of money, in so far as 
it is directed to facilitate the use of money, is like a habit. Now in 
parting with a thing ---for instance, when we throw something---the 
farther we put it away the greater the force [virtus] employed. Hence 
parting with money by giving it to  others proceeds from a greater virtue 
than when we spend it on ourselves. But it is proper to a virtue as such 
to tend to what is more perfect, since "virtue is a kind of perfection" 
(Phys. vii, text. 17,18). Therefore a liberal man is praised chiefly for 
giving.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It belongs to prudence to keep money, lest it be stolen or 
spent uselessly. But to spend it usefully is not less but more prudent 
than to keep it usefully: since more things have to be considered in 
money's use, which is likened to movement, than in its keeping, which is 
likened to rest. As to those who, having received money that others have 
earned, spend it more liberally, through not having experienced the want 
of it, if their inexperience is the sole cause of their liberal 
expenditure they have not the virtue of liberality. Sometimes, however, 
this inexperience merely removes the impediment to liberality, so that it 
makes them all the more ready to act liberally, because, not 
unfrequently, the fear of want that results from the experience of want 
hinders those who have acquired money from using it up by acting with 
liberality; as does likewise the love they have for it as being their own 
effect, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iv, 1).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in this and the preceding Article, it belongs to 
liberality to make fitting use of money, and consequently to give it in a 
fitting manner, since this is a use of money. Again, every virtue is 
grieved by whatever is contrary to its act, and avoids whatever hinders 
that act. Now two things are opposed to suitable giving; namely, not 
giving what ought suitably to be given, and giving something unsuitably. 
Wherefore the liberal man is grieved at both: but especially at the 
former, since it is more opposed to his proper act. For this reason, too, 
he does not give to all: since his act would be hindered were he to give 
to everyone: for he would not have the means of giving to those to whom 
it were fitting for him to give.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Giving and receiving are related to one another as action 
and passion. Now the same thing is not the principle of both action and 
passion. Hence, since liberality is a principle of giving, it does not 
belong to the liberal man to be ready to receive, and still less to beg. 
Hence the verse:<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; 'In this world he that wishes to be pleasing to many Should give often, 
take seldom, ask never.' But he makes provision in order to give certain 
things according as liberality requires; such are the fruits of his own 
possessions, for he is careful about realizing them that he may make a 
liberal use thereof.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> To spend on oneself is an inclination of nature; hence to 
spend money on others belongs properly to a virtue.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is not a part of justice. For  justice 
regards that which is due. Now the more a thing is due the less liberally 
is it given. Therefore liberality is not a part of justice, but is 
incompatible with it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, justice is about operation as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS060.html#FSQ60ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3): whereas liberality is chiefly about the love and 
desire of money, which are passions. Therefore liberality seems to belong 
to temperance rather than to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it belongs chiefly to liberality to give becomingly, as 
stated (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But giving becomingly belongs to beneficence and mercy, 
which pertain to charity, as state above (<A Href="SS000.html#SSQOUTP1">Questions [30]</a>,31). Therefore 
liberality is a part of charity rather than of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i): "Justice has to do with the 
fellowship of mankind. For the notion of fellowship is divided into two 
parts, justice and beneficence, also called liberality or 
kind-heartedness." Therefore liberality pertains to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Liberality is not a species of justice, since justice 
pays another what is his whereas liberality gives another what is one's 
own. There are, however, two points in which it agrees with justice: 
first, that it is directed chiefly to another, as justice is; secondly, 
that it is concerned with external things, and so is justice, albeit 
under a different aspect, a stated in this Article and above (<A Href="SS117.html#SSQ117A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). Hence it is that liberality is reckoned by some to be a part of 
justice, being annexed thereto as to a principal virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although liberality does no consider the legal due that 
justice considers, it considers a certain moral due. This due is based on 
a certain fittingness and not on an obligation: so that it answers to the 
idea of due in the lowest degree.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Temperance is about concupiscence in pleasures of the body. 
But the concupiscence and delight in money is not referable to the body 
but rather to the soul. Hence liberality does not properly pertain to 
temperance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The giving of beneficence and mercy proceeds from the fact 
that a man has a certain affection towards the person to whom he gives: 
wherefore this giving belongs to charity or friendship. But the giving of 
liberality arises from a person being affected in a certain way towards 
money, in that he desires it not nor loves it: so that when it is fitting 
he gives it not only to his friends but also to those whom he knows not. 
Hence it belong not to charity, but to justice, which is about external 
things.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether liberality is the greatest of the virtues?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that liberality is the greatest of the  virtues. For 
every virtue of man is a likeness to the divine goodness. Now man is 
likened chiefly by liberality to God, "Who giveth to all men abundantly, 
and upbraideth not" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?James+1:5">James 1:5</a>). Therefore liberality is the greatest of 
the virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Augustine (De Trin. vi, 8), "in things that 
are great, but not in bulk, to be greatest is to be best." Now the nature 
of goodness seems to pertain mostly to liberality, since "the good is 
self-communicative," according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv). Hence Ambrose 
says (De Offic. i) that "justice reclines to severity, liberality to 
goodness." Therefore liberality is the greatest of virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are honored and loved on account of virtue. Now 
Boethius says (De Consol. ii) that "bounty above all makes a man famous": 
and the Philosopher says (Ethic. iv, 1) that "among the virtuous the 
liberal are the most beloved." Therefore liberality is the greatest of 
virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Offic. i) that "justice seems to be 
more excellent than liberality, although liberality is more pleasing." 
The Philosopher also says (Rhet. i, 9) that "brave and just men are 
honored chiefly and, after them, those who are liberal."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every virtue tends towards a good; wherefore the greater 
virtue is that which tends towards the greater good. Now liberality tends 
towards a good in two ways: in one way, primarily and of its own nature; 
in another way, consequently. Primarily and of its very nature it tends 
to set in order one's own affection towards the possession and use of 
money. In this way temperance, which moderates desires and pleasures 
relating to one's own body, takes precedence of liberality: and so do 
fortitude and justice, which, in a manner, are directed to the common 
good, one in time of peace, the other in time of war: while all these are 
preceded by those virtues which are directed to the Divine good. For the 
Divine good surpasses all manner of human good; and among human goods the 
public good surpasses the good of the individual; and of the last named 
the good of the body surpasses those goods that consist of external 
things. Again, liberality is ordained to a good consequently, and in this 
way it is directed to all the aforesaid goods. For by reason of his not 
being a lover of money, it follows that a man readily makes use of it, 
whether for himself. Or for the good of others, or for God's glory. Thus 
it derives a certain excellence from being useful in many ways. Since, 
however, we should judge of things according to that which is competent 
to them primarily and in respect of their nature, rather than according 
to that which pertains to them consequently, it remains to be said that 
liberality is not the greatest of virtues.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God's giving proceeds from His love for those to whom He 
gives, not from His affection towards the things He gives, wherefore it 
seems to pertain to charity, the greatest of virtues, rather than to 
liberality. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Every virtue shares the nature of goodness by giving forth 
its own act: and the acts of certain other virtues are better than money 
which liberality gives forth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[117] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The friendship whereby a liberal man is beloved is not that 
which is based on virtue, as though he were better than others, but that 
which is based on utility, because he is more useful in external goods, 
which as a rule men desire above all others. For the same reason he 
becomes famous.<br>
