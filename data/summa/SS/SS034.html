<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must how consider the vices opposed to charity: (1) hatred, which is 
opposed to love; (2) sloth and envy, which are opposed to the joy of 
charity; (3) discord and schism, which are contrary to peace; (4) offense 
and scandal, which are contrary to beneficence and fraternal correction.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no man can hate God. For Dionysius says (Div. 
Nom. iv) that "the first good and beautiful is an object of love and 
dilection to all." But God is goodness and beauty itself. Therefore He is 
hated by none.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the Apocryphal books of 3 Esdras 4:36,[39] it is 
written that "all things call upon truth . . . and (all men) do well like 
of her works." Now God is the very truth according to Jn. 14:6. Therefore 
all love God, and none can hate Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, hatred is a kind of aversion. But according to Dionysius 
(Div. Nom. i) God draws all things to Himself. Therefore none can hate 
Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++73:23">Ps. 73:23</a>): "The pride of them that hate 
Thee ascendeth continually," and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++15:24">Jn. 15:24</a>): "But now  they have both 
seen and hated both Me and My Father."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As shown above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS029.html#FSQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS029.html#FSQ29A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), hatred is a movement of 
the appetitive power, which power is not set in motion save by something 
apprehended. Now God can be apprehended by man in two ways; first, in 
Himself, as when He is seen in His Essence; secondly, in His effects, 
when, to wit, "the invisible things" of God . . . "are clearly seen, 
being understood by the things that are made" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:20">Rm. 1:20</a>). Now God in His 
Essence is goodness itself, which no man can hate---for it is natural to 
good to be loved. Hence it is impossible for one who sees God in His 
Essence, to hate Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover some of His effects are such that they can nowise be contrary 
to the human will, since "to be, to live, to understand," which are 
effects of God, are desirable and lovable to all. Wherefore again God 
cannot be an object of hatred if we consider Him as the Author of such 
like effects. Some of God's effects, however, are contrary to an 
inordinate will, such as the infliction of punishment, and the 
prohibition of sin by the Divine Law. Such like effects are repugnant to 
a will debased by sin, and as regards the consideration of them, God may 
be an object of hatred to some, in so far as they look upon Him as 
forbidding sin, and inflicting punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This argument is true of those who see God's Essence, which 
is the very essence of goodness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument is true in so far as God is apprehended as 
the cause of such effects as are naturally beloved of all, among which 
are the works of Truth who reveals herself to men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> God draws all things to Himself, in so far as He is the 
source of being, since all things, in as much as they are, tend to be 
like God, Who is Being itself.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hatred of God is the greatest of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hatred of God is not the greatest of sins. For 
the most grievous sin is the sin against the Holy Ghost, since it cannot 
be forgiven, according to Mt. 12:32. Now hatred of God is not reckoned 
among the various kinds of sin against the Holy Ghost, as may be seen 
from what has been said above (<A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>, <A Href="SS014.html#SSQ14A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore hatred of God is 
not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin consists in withdrawing oneself from God. Now an 
unbeliever who has not even knowledge of God seems to be further away 
from Him than a believer, who though he hate God, nevertheless knows Him. 
Therefore it seems that the sin of unbelief is graver than the sin of 
hatred against God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God is an object of hatred, only by reason of those of 
His effects that are contrary to the will: the chief of  which is 
punishment. But hatred of punishment is not the most grievous sin. 
Therefore hatred of God is not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The best is opposite to the worst, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 10). But hatred of God is contrary to the love 
of God, wherein man's best consists. Therefore hatred of God is man's 
worst sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The defect in sin consists in its aversion from God, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1">Question [10]</a>, <A Href="SS010.html#SSQ10A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): and this aversion would not have the 
character of guilt, were it not voluntary. Hence the nature of guilt 
consists in a voluntary aversion from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this voluntary aversion from God is directly implied in the hatred 
of God, but in other sins, by participation and indirectly. For just as 
the will cleaves directly to what it loves, so does it directly shun what 
it hates. Hence when a man hates God, his will is directly averted from 
God, whereas in other sins, fornication for instance, a man turns away 
from God, not directly, but indirectly, in so far, namely, as he desires 
an inordinate pleasure, to which aversion from God is connected. Now that 
which is so by itself, always takes precedence of that which is so by 
another. Wherefore hatred of God is more grievous than other sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Gregory (Moral. xxv, 11), "it is one thing not 
to do good things, end another to hate the giver of good things, even as 
it is one thing to sin indeliberately, and another to sin deliberately." 
This implies that to hate God, the giver of all good things, is to sin 
deliberately, and this is a sin against the Holy Ghost. Hence it is 
evident that hatred of God is chiefly a sin against the Holy Ghost, in so 
far as the sin against the Holy Ghost denotes a special kind of sin: and 
yet it is not reckoned among the kinds of sin against the Holy Ghost, 
because it is universally found in every kind of that sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even unbelief is not sinful unless it be voluntary: 
wherefore the more voluntary it is, the more it is sinful. Now it becomes 
voluntary by the fact that a man hates the truth that is proposed to him. 
Wherefore it is evident that unbelief derives its sinfulness from hatred 
of God, Whose truth is the object of faith; and hence just as a cause is 
greater than its effect, so hatred of God is a greater sin than unbelief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not everyone who hates his punishment, hates God the author 
of punishments. For many hate the punishments inflicted on them, and yet 
they bear them patiently out of reverence for the Divine justice. 
Wherefore Augustine says (Confess. x) that God commands us to bear with 
penal evils, not to love them. On the other hand, to break out into 
hatred of God when He inflicts those punishments, is to hate God's very 
justice, and that is a most grievous sin. Hence Gregory says (Moral. xxv, 
11): "Even as sometimes it is more grievous to love sin than to do it, so 
is it more wicked to hate justice than, not to have done it."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hatred of one's neighbor is always a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hatred of one's neighbor is not always a sin. 
For no sin is commanded or counselled by God, according to Prov. 8:8: 
"All My words are just, there is nothing wicked nor perverse in them." 
Now, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++14:26">Lk. 14:26</a>): "If any man come to Me, and hate not his 
father and mother . . . he cannot be My disciple." Therefore hatred of 
one's neighbor is not always a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing wherein we imitate God can be a sin. But it is 
in imitation of God that we hate certain people: for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++1:30">Rm. 1:30</a>): "Detractors, hateful to God." Therefore it is possible to hate 
certain people without committing a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing that is natural is a sin, for sin is a 
"wandering away from what is according to nature," according to Damascene 
(De Fide Orth. ii, 4,30; iv, 20). Now it is natural to a thing to hate 
whatever is contrary to it, and to aim at its undoing. Therefore it seems 
that it is not a sin to hate one's I enemy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Jn++2:9">1 Jn. 2:9</a>): "He that . . . hateth his 
brother, is in darkness." Now spiritual darkness is sin. Therefore there 
cannot be hatred of one's neighbor without sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Hatred is opposed to love, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS029.html#FSQ29OUTP1">Question [29]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS029.html#FSQ29A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); so that hatred of a thing is evil according as the love of that 
thing is good. Now love is due to our neighbor in respect of what he 
holds from God, i.e. in respect of nature and grace, but not in respect 
of what he has of himself and from the devil, i.e. in respect of sin and 
lack of justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently it is lawful to hate the sin in one's brother, and whatever 
pertains to the defect of Divine justice, but we cannot hate our 
brother's nature and grace without sin. Now it is part of our love for 
our brother that we hate the fault and the lack of good in him, since 
desire for another's good is equivalent to hatred of his evil. 
Consequently the hatred of one's brother, if we consider it simply, is 
always sinful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By the commandment of God (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++20:12">Ex. 20:12</a>) we must honor our 
parents---as united to us in nature and kinship. But we must hate them in 
so far as they prove an obstacle to our attaining the perfection of 
Divine justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God hates the sin which is in the detractor, not his 
nature: so that we can hate detractors without committing a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Men are not opposed to us in respect of the goods which 
they have received from God: wherefore, in this respect, we should love 
them. But they are opposed to us, in so far as they  show hostility 
towards us, and this is sinful in them. In this respect we should hate 
them, for we should hate in them the fact that they are hostile to us.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hatred of our neighbor is the most grievous 
sin against our neighbor. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Jn++3:15">1 Jn. 3:15</a>): "Whosoever 
hateth his brother is a murderer." Now murder is the most grievous of 
sins against our neighbor. Therefore hatred is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, worst is opposed to best. Now the best thing we give our 
neighbor is love, since all other things are referable to love. Therefore 
hatred is the worst.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A thing is said to be evil, because it hurts, as 
Augustine observes (Enchiridion xii). Now there are sins by which a man 
hurts his neighbor more than by hatred, e.g. theft, murder and adultery. 
Therefore hatred is not the most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Moreover, Chrysostom [*Hom. x in the Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed 
to St. John Chrysostom] commenting on Mt. 5:19, "He that shall break one 
of these least commandments," says: "The commandments of Moses, Thou 
shalt not kill, Thou shalt not commit adultery, count for little in their 
reward, but they count for much if they be disobeyed. On the other hand 
the commandments of Christ such as, Thou shalt not be angry, Thou shalt 
not desire, are reckoned great in their reward, but little in the 
transgression." Now hatred is an internal movement like anger and desire. 
Therefore hatred of one's brother is a less grievous sin than murder.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sins committed against our neighbor are evil on two 
counts; first by reason of the disorder in the person who sins, secondly 
by reason of the hurt inflicted on the person sinned against. On the 
first count, hatred is a more grievous sin than external actions that 
hurt our neighbor, because hatred is a disorder of man's will, which is 
the chief part of man, and wherein is the root of sin, so that if a man's 
outward actions were to be inordinate, without any disorder in his will, 
they would not be sinful, for instance, if he were to kill a man, through 
ignorance or out of zeal for justice: and if there be anything sinful in 
a man's outward sins against his neighbor, it is all to be traced to his 
inward hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, as regards the hurt inflicted on his neighbor, a 
man's outward sins are worse than his inward hatred. This suffices for 
the Replies to the Objections.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that hatred is a capital sin. For hatred is 
directly opposed to charity. Now charity is the foremost among the 
virtues, and the mother of all others. Therefore hatred is the chief of 
the capital sins, and the origin of all others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sins arise in us on account of the inclinations of our 
passions, according to Rm. 7:5: "The passions of sins . . . did work in 
our members to bring forth fruit unto death." Now all other passions of 
the soul seem to arise from love and hatred, as was shown above (FS, 
Question [25], Articles [1],2). Therefore hatred should be reckoned one of the capital 
sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi) does not reckon hatred among the 
seven capital sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS084.html#FSQ84ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4), a capital vice is 
one from which other vices arise most frequently. Now vice is contrary to 
man's nature, in as much as he is a rational animal: and when a thing 
acts contrary to its nature, that which is natural to it is corrupted 
little by little. Consequently it must first of all fail in that which is 
less in accordance with its nature, and last of all in that which is most 
in accordance with its nature, since what is first in construction is 
last in destruction. Now that which, first and foremost, is most natural 
to man, is the love of what is good, and especially love of the Divine 
good, and of his neighbor's good. Wherefore hatred, which is opposed to 
this love, is not the first but the last thing in the downfall of virtue 
resulting from vice: and therefore it is not a capital vice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated in Phys. vii, text. 18, "the virtue of a thing 
consists in its being well disposed in accordance with its nature." Hence 
what is first and foremost in the virtues must be first and foremost in 
the natural order. Hence charity is reckoned the foremost of the virtues, 
and for the same reason hatred cannot be first among the vices, as stated 
above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Hatred of the evil that is contrary to one's natural good, 
is the first of the soul's passions, even as love of one's natural good 
is. But hatred of one's connatural good cannot be first, but is something 
last, because such like hatred is a proof of an already corrupted nature, 
even as love of an extraneous good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Evil is twofold. One is a true evil, for the reason that it 
is incompatible with one's natural good, and the hatred of such an evil 
may have priority over the other passions. There is, however, another 
which is not a true, but an apparent evil, which, namely, is a true and 
connatural good, and yet is reckoned evil on account of the corruption of 
nature: and the hatred of such an evil must needs come last. This hatred 
is  vicious, but the former is not.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether hatred arises from envy?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that hatred does not arise from envy. For envy is sorrow 
for another's good. Now hatred does not arise from sorrow, for, on the 
contrary, we grieve for the presence of the evil we hate. Therefore 
hatred does not arise from envy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, hatred is opposed to love. Now love of our neighbor is 
referred to our love of God, as stated above (<A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="SS025.html#SSQ25A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26OUTP1">Question [26]</a>, <A Href="SS026.html#SSQ26A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore hatred of our neighbor is referred to our hatred of God. But 
hatred of God does not arise from envy, for we do not envy those who are 
very far removed from us, but rather those who seem to be near us, as the 
Philosopher states (Rhet. ii). Therefore hatred does not arise from envy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to one effect there is one cause. Now hatred is caused 
by anger, for Augustine says in his Rule that "anger grows into hatred." 
Therefore hatred does not arise from envy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "out of envy cometh 
hatred."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS034.html#SSQ34A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), hatred of his neighbor is a man's 
last step in the path of sin, because it is opposed to the love which he 
naturally has for his neighbor. Now if a man declines from that which is 
natural, it is because he intends to avoid that which is naturally an 
object to be shunned. Now every animal naturally avoids sorrow, just as 
it desires pleasure, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. vii, x). 
Accordingly just as love arises from pleasure, so does hatred arise from 
sorrow. For just as we are moved to love whatever gives us pleasure, in 
as much as for that very reason it assumes the aspect of good; so we are 
moved to hate whatever displeases us, in so far as for this very reason 
it assumes the aspect of evil. Wherefore, since envy is sorrow for our 
neighbor's good, it follows that our neighbor's good becomes hateful to 
us, so that "out of envy cometh hatred."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since the appetitive power, like the apprehensive power, 
reflects on its own acts, it follows that there is a kind of circular 
movement in the actions of the appetitive power. And so according to the 
first forward course of the appetitive movement, love gives rise to 
desire, whence follows pleasure when one has obtained what one desired. 
And since the very fact of taking pleasure in the good one loves is a 
kind of good, it follows that pleasure causes love. And in the same way 
sorrow causes hatred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Love and hatred are essentially different, for the object 
of love is good, which flows from God to creatures, wherefore love is due 
to God in the first place, and to our neighbor afterwards. On the other 
hand, hatred is of evil, which has no place in God Himself, but only in 
His effects, for which  reason it has been stated above (<A Href="SS034.html#SSQ34A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that God 
is not an object of hatred, except in so far as He is considered in 
relation to His effects, and consequently hatred is directed to our 
neighbor before being directed to God. Therefore, since envy of our 
neighbor is the mother of hatred of our neighbor, it becomes, in 
consequence, the cause of hatred towards God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[34] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nothing prevents a thing arising from various causes in 
various respects, and accordingly hatred may arise both from anger and 
from envy. However it arises more directly from envy, which looks upon 
the very good of our neighbor as displeasing and therefore hateful, 
whereas hatred arises from anger by way of increase. For at first, 
through anger, we desire our neighbor's evil according to a certain 
measure, that is in so far as that evil has the aspect of vengeance: but 
afterwards, through the continuance of anger, man goes so far as 
absolutely to desire his neighbor's evil, which desire is part of hatred. 
Wherefore it is evident that hatred is caused by envy formally as regards 
the aspect of the object, but dispositively by anger.<br>
