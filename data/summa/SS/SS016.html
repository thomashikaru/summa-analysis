<H3 Align="Left">Whether in the Old Law there should have been given precepts of faith?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that, in the Old Law, there should have been given 
precepts of faith. Because a precept is about something due and 
necessary. Now it is most necessary for man that he should believe, 
according to Heb. 11:6, "Without faith it is impossible to please God." 
Therefore there was very great need for precepts of faith to be given.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the New Testament is contained in the Old, as the 
reality in the figure, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS107.html#FSQ107OUTP1">Question [107]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS107.html#FSQ107A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now the New 
Testament contains explicit precepts of faith, for instance Jn. 14:1: 
"You believe in God; believe also in Me." Therefore it seems that some 
precepts of faith ought to have been given in the Old Law also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, to prescribe the act of a virtue comes to the same as to 
forbid the opposite vices. Now the Old Law contained  many precepts 
forbidding unbelief: thus (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++20:3">Ex. 20:3</a>): "Thou shalt not have strange gods 
before Me," and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++13:1-3">Dt. 13:1-3</a>) they were forbidden to hear the words of the 
prophet or dreamer who might wish to turn them away from their faith in 
God. Therefore precepts of faith should have been given in the Old Law 
also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, confession is an act of faith, as stated above (<A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="SS003.html#SSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the Old Law contained precepts about the confession and the 
promulgation of faith: for they were commanded (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++12:27">Ex. 12:27</a>) that, when 
their children should ask them, they should tell them the meaning of the 
paschal observance, and (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++13:9">Dt. 13:9</a>) they were commanded to slay anyone who 
disseminated doctrine contrary to faith. Therefore the Old Law should 
have contained precepts of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, all the books of the Old Testament are contained in the 
Old Law; wherefore Our Lord said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++15:25">Jn. 15:25</a>) that it was written in the 
Law: "They have hated Me without cause," although this is found written 
in Ps. 34 and 68. Now it is written (Ecclus. 2:8): "Ye that fear the 
Lord, believe Him." Therefore the Old Law should have contained precepts 
of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++3:27">Rm. 3:27</a>) calls the Old Law the "law of 
works" which he contrasts with the "law of faith." Therefore the Old Law 
ought not to have contained precepts of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A master does not impose laws on others than his 
subjects; wherefore the precepts of a law presuppose that everyone who 
receives the law is subject to the giver of the law. Now the primary 
subjection of man to God is by faith, according to Heb. 11:6: "He that 
cometh to God, must believe that He is." Hence faith is presupposed to 
the precepts of the Law: for which reason (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++20:2">Ex. 20:2</a>) that which is of 
faith, is set down before the legal precepts, in the words, "I am the 
Lord thy God, Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt," and, likewise 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++6:4">Dt. 6:4</a>), the words, "Hear, O Israel, the Lord thy [Vulg.: 'our'] God is 
one," precede the recording of the precepts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, however, faith contains many things subordinate to the faith 
whereby we believe that God is, which is the first and chief of all 
articles of faith, as stated above (<A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="SS001.html#SSQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,7), it follows that, if 
we presuppose faith in God, whereby man's mind is subjected to Him, it is 
possible for precepts to be given about other articles of faith. Thus 
Augustine expounding the words: "This is My commandment" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++15:12">Jn. 15:12</a>) says 
(Tract. lxxxiii in Joan.) that we have received many precepts of faith. 
In the Old Law, however, the secret things of faith were not to be set 
before the people, wherefore, presupposing their faith in one God, no 
other precepts of faith were given in the Old Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Faith is necessary as being the principle of spiritual 
life, wherefore it is presupposed before the receiving of the Law. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Even then Our Lord both presupposed something of faith, 
namely belief in one God, when He said: "You believe in God," and 
commanded something, namely, belief in the Incarnation whereby one Person 
is God and man. This explanation of faith belongs to the faith of the New 
Testament, wherefore He added: "Believe also in Me."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The prohibitive precepts regard sins, which corrupt virtue. 
Now virtue is corrupted by any particular defect, as stated above (FS, 
Question [18], Article [4], ad 3; FS, Question [19], Article [6], ad 1, Article [7], ad 3). Therefore faith in 
one God being presupposed, prohibitive precepts had to be given in the 
Old Law, so that men might be warned off those particular defects whereby 
their faith might be corrupted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Confession of faith and the teaching thereof also 
presuppose man's submission to God by faith: so that the Old Law could 
contain precepts relating to the confession and teaching of faith, rather 
than to faith itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> In this passage again that faith is presupposed whereby we 
believe that God is; hence it begins, "Ye that fear the Lord," which is 
not possible without faith. The words which follow---"believe Him"---must 
be referred to certain special articles of faith, chiefly to those things 
which God promises to them that obey Him, wherefore the passage 
concludes---"and your reward shall not be made void."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the precepts referring to knowledge and understanding were fittingly set down in the Old Law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts referring to knowledge and 
understanding were unfittingly set down in the Old Law. For knowledge and 
understanding pertain to cognition. Now cognition precedes and directs 
action. Therefore the precepts referring to knowledge and understanding 
should precede the precepts of the Law referring to action. Since, then, 
the first precepts of the Law are those of the decalogue, it seems that 
precepts of knowledge and understanding should have been given a place 
among the precepts of the decalogue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, learning precedes teaching, for a man must learn from 
another before he teaches another. Now the Old Law contains precepts 
about teaching---both affirmative precepts as, for example, (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++4:9">Dt. 4:9</a>), 
"Thou shalt teach them to thy sons"---and prohibitive precepts, as, for 
instance, (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++4:2">Dt. 4:2</a>), "You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, 
neither shall you take away from it." Therefore it seems that man ought 
to have been given also some precepts directing him to learn.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, knowledge and understanding seem more necessary to a 
priest than to a king, wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Malachi+2:7">Malachi 2:7</a>): "The lips 
of the priest shall keep knowledge, and  they shall seek the law at his 
mouth," and (Osee 4:6): "Because thou hast rejected knowledge, I will 
reject thee, that thou shalt not do the office of priesthood to Me." Now 
the king is commanded to learn knowledge of the Law (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++17:18,19">Dt. 17:18,19</a>). Much 
more therefore should the Law have commanded the priests to learn the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is not possible while asleep to meditate on things 
pertaining to knowledge and understanding: moreover it is hindered by 
extraneous occupations. Therefore it is unfittingly commanded (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++6:7">Dt. 6:7</a>): 
"Thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy 
journey, sleeping and rising." Therefore the precepts relating to 
knowledge and understanding are unfittingly set down in the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++4:6">Dt. 4:6</a>): "That, hearing all these 
precepts, they may say, Behold a wise and understanding people."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Three things may be considered in relation to knowledge 
and understanding: first, the reception thereof; secondly, the use; and 
thirdly, their preservation. Now the reception of knowledge or 
understanding, is by means of teaching and learning, and both are 
prescribed in the Law. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++6:6">Dt. 6:6</a>): "These words which I 
command thee . . . shall be in thy heart." This refers to learning, since 
it is the duty of a disciple to apply his mind to what is said, while the 
words that follow---"and thou shalt tell them to thy children"---refer to 
teaching.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The use of knowledge and understanding is the meditation on those things 
which one knows or understands. In reference to this, the text goes on: 
"thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house," etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Their preservation is effected by the memory, and, as regards this, the 
text continues---"and thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and 
they shall be and shall move between thy eyes. And thou shalt write them 
in the entry, and on the doors of thy house." Thus the continual 
remembrance of God's commandments is signified, since it is impossible 
for us to forget those things which are continually attracting the notice 
of our senses, whether by touch, as those things we hold in our hands, or 
by sight, as those things which are ever before our eyes, or to which we 
are continually returning, for instance, to the house door. Moreover it 
is clearly stated (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++4:9">Dt. 4:9</a>): "Forget not the words that thy eyes have 
seen and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We read of these things also being commanded more notably in the New 
Testament, both in the teaching of the Gospel and in that of the apostles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Dt. 4:6, "this is your wisdom and 
understanding in the sight of the nations." By this we are given to 
understand that the wisdom and understanding of those who believe  in God 
consist in the precepts of the Law. Wherefore the precepts of the Law had 
to be given first, and afterwards men had to be led to know and 
understand them, and so it was not fitting that the aforesaid precepts 
should be placed among the precepts of the decalogue which take the first 
place.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There are also in the Law precepts relating to learning, as 
stated above. Nevertheless teaching was commanded more expressly than 
learning, because it concerned the learned, who were not under any other 
authority, but were immediately under the law, and to them the precepts 
of the Law were given. On the other hand learning concerned the people of 
lower degree, and these the precepts of the Law have to reach through the 
learned.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Knowledge of the Law is so closely bound up with the 
priestly office that being charged with the office implies being charged 
to know the Law: hence there was no need for special precepts to be given 
about the training of the priests. On the other hand, the doctrine of 
God's law is not so bound up with the kingly office, because a king is 
placed over his people in temporal matters: hence it is especially 
commanded that the king should be instructed by the priests about things 
pertaining to the law of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[16] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> That precept of the Law does not mean that man should 
meditate on God's law of sleeping, but during sleep, i.e. that he should 
meditate on the law of God when he is preparing to sleep, because this 
leads to his having better phantasms while asleep, in so far as our 
movements pass from the state of vigil to the state of sleep, as the 
Philosopher explains (Ethic. i, 13). In like manner we are commanded to 
meditate on the Law in every action of ours, not that we are bound to be 
always actually thinking about the Law, but that we should regulate all 
our actions according to it.<br>
