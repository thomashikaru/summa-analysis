<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider daring; and under this head there are two points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ127A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether daring is a sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ127A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is opposed to fortitude?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that daring is not a sin. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Job+39:21">Job 39:21</a>) 
concerning the horse, by which according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi) the 
godly preacher is denoted, that "he goeth forth boldly to meet armed men 
[*Vulg.: 'he pranceth boldly, he goeth forth to meet armed men']." But no 
vice redounds to a man's praise. Therefore it is not a sin to be daring.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 9), "one should 
take counsel in thought, and do quickly what has been counseled." But 
daring helps this quickness in doing. Therefore  daring is not sinful but 
praiseworthy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, daring is a passion caused by hope, as stated above (FS, 
Question [45], Article [2]) when we were treating of the passions. But hope is accounted 
not a sin but a virtue. Neither therefore should daring be accounted a 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ecclus. 8:18): "Go not on the way with a 
bold man, lest he burden thee with his evils." Now no man's fellowship is 
to be avoided save on account of sin. Therefore daring is a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Daring, as stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23OUTP1">Question [23]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS023.html#FSQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="SS055.html#SSQ55OUTP1">Question [55]</a>), is a 
passion. Now a passion is sometimes moderated according to reason, and 
sometimes it lacks moderation, either by excess or by deficiency, and on 
this account the passion is sinful. Again, the names of the passions are 
sometimes employed in the sense of excess, thus we speak of anger meaning 
not any but excessive anger, in which case it is sinful, and in the same 
way daring as implying excess is accounted a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The daring spoken of there is that which is moderated by 
reason, for in that sense it belongs to the virtue of fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is praiseworthy to act quickly after taking counsel, 
which is an act of reason. But to wish to act quickly before taking 
counsel is not praiseworthy but sinful; for this would be to act rashly, 
which is a vice contrary to prudence, as stated above (<A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>, <A Href="SS058.html#SSQ58A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). 
Wherefore daring which leads one to act quickly is so far praiseworthy as 
it is directed by reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some vices are unnamed, and so also are some virtues, as 
the Philosopher remarks (Ethic. ii, 7; iv, 4,5,6). Hence the names of 
certain passions have to be applied to certain vices and virtues: and in 
order to designate vices we employ especially the names of those passions 
the object of which is an evil, as in the case of hatred, fear, anger and 
daring. But hope and love have a good for this object, and so we use them 
rather to designate virtues.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that daring is not opposed to fortitude. For excess of 
daring seems to result from presumption of mind. But presumption pertains 
to pride which is opposed to humility. Therefore daring is opposed to 
humility rather than to fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, daring does not seem to call for blame, except in so far 
as it results in harm either to the daring person who puts himself in 
danger inordinately, or to others whom he attacks with daring, or exposes 
to danger. But this seemingly pertains to injustice. Therefore daring, as 
designating a sin, is opposed, not  to fortitude but to justice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fortitude is concerned about fear and daring, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now since timidity is opposed to fortitude in 
respect of an excess of fear, there is another vice opposed to timidity 
in respect of a lack of fear. If then, daring is opposed to fortitude, in 
the point of excessive daring, there will likewise be a vice opposed to 
it in the point of deficient daring. But there is no such vice. Therefore 
neither should daring be accounted a vice in opposition to fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Philosopher in both the Second and Third Books of 
Ethics accounts daring to be opposed to fortitude.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS126.html#SSQ126OUTP1">Question [126]</a>, <A Href="SS126.html#SSQ126A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it belongs to a moral 
virtue to observe the rational mean in the matter about which it is 
concerned. Wherefore every vice that denotes lack of moderation in the 
matter of a moral virtue is opposed to that virtue, as immoderate to 
moderate. Now daring, in so far as it denotes a vice, implies excess of 
passion, and this excess goes by the name of daring. Wherefore it is 
evident that it is opposed to the virtue of fortitude which is concerned 
about fear and daring, as stated above (<A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1">Question [122]</a>, <A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Opposition between vice and virtue does not depend chiefly 
on the cause of the vice but on the vice's very species. Wherefore it is 
not necessary that daring be opposed to the same virtue as presumption 
which is its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the direct opposition of a vice does not depend on 
its cause, so neither does it depend on its effect. Now the harm done by 
daring is its effect. Wherefore neither does the opposition of daring 
depend on this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[127] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The movement of daring consists in a man taking the 
offensive against that which is in opposition to him: and nature inclines 
him to do this except in so far as such inclination is hindered by the 
fear of receiving harm from that source. Hence the vice which exceeds in 
daring has no contrary deficiency, save only timidity. Yet daring does 
not always accompany so great a lack of timidity, for as the Philosopher 
says (Ethic. iii, 7), "the daring are precipitate and eager to meet 
danger, yet fail when the danger is present," namely through fear.<br>
