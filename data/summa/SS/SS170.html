<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts of temperance are unsuitably 
given in the Divine law. Because fortitude is a greater virtue than 
temperance, as stated above (<A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123OUTP1">Question [123]</a>, <A Href="SS123.html#SSQ123A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>; <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141OUTP1">Question [141]</a>, <A Href="SS141.html#SSQ141A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS066.html#FSQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS066.html#FSQ66A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Now there is no precept of fortitude among the precepts of the 
decalogue, which are the most important among the precepts of the Law. 
Therefore it was unfitting to include among the precepts of the decalogue 
the prohibition of adultery, which is contrary to temperance, as stated 
above (<A Href="SS154.html#SSQ154OUTP1">Question [154]</a>, <A Href="SS154.html#SSQ154ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,8).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, temperance is not only about venereal matters, but also 
about pleasures of meat and drink. Now the precepts of the decalogue 
include no prohibition of a vice pertaining to pleasures of meat and 
drink, or to any other species of lust. Neither, therefore, should they 
include a precept prohibiting adultery, which pertains to venereal 
pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the lawgiver's intention inducement to virtue 
precedes the prohibition of vice, since vices are forbidden in order that 
obstacles to virtue may be removed. Now the precepts  of the decalogue 
are the most important in the Divine law. Therefore the precepts of the 
decalogue should have included an affirmative precept directly 
prescribing the virtue of temperance, rather than a negative precept 
forbidding adultery which is directly opposed thereto.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the authority of Scripture in the decalogue (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++20:14,17">Ex. 20:14,17</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++1:5">1 Tim. 1:5</a>), "the end of the 
commandment is charity," which is enjoined upon us in the two precepts 
concerning the love of God and of our neighbor. Wherefore the decalogue 
contains those precepts which tend more directly to the love of God and 
of our neighbor. Now among the vices opposed to temperance, adultery 
would seem most of all opposed to the love of our neighbor, since thereby 
a man lays hold of another's property for his own use, by abusing his 
neighbor's wife. Wherefore the precepts of the decalogue include a 
special prohibition of adultery, not only as committed in deed, but also 
as desired in thought.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Among the species of vices opposed to fortitude there is 
not one that is so directly opposed to the love of our neighbor as 
adultery, which is a species of lust that is opposed to temperance. And 
yet the vice of daring, which is opposed to fortitude, is wont to be 
sometimes the cause of murder, which is forbidden by one of the precepts 
of the decalogue: for it is written (Ecclus. 8:18): "Go not on the way 
with a bold man lest he burden thee with his evils."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gluttony is not directly opposed to the love of our 
neighbor, as adultery is. Nor indeed is any other species of lust, for a 
father is not so wronged by the seduction of the virgin over whom he has 
no connubial right, as is the husband by the adultery of his wife, for 
he, not the wife herself, has power over her body [*1 Cor. 7:4].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122OUTP1">Question [122]</a>, <A Href="SS122.html#SSQ122ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4) the precepts of the 
decalogue are universal principles of the Divine law; hence they need to 
be common precepts. Now it was not possible to give any common 
affirmative precepts of temperance, because the practice of temperance 
varies according to different times, as Augustine remarks (De Bono 
Conjug. xv, 7), and according to different human laws and customs.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the precepts of the virtues annexed to temperance are suitably given in the Divine law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the precepts of the virtues annexed to 
temperance are unsuitably given in the Divine law. For the precepts of 
the Decalogue, as stated above (<A Href="SS170.html#SSQ170A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3), are certain universal 
principles of the whole Divine law. Now "pride is the beginning of all 
sin," according to Ecclus. 10:15. Therefore among  the precepts of the 
Decalogue there should have been one forbidding pride.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a place before all should have been given in the 
decalogue to those precepts by which men are especially induced to fulfil 
the Law, because these would seem to be the most important. Now since 
humility subjects man to God, it would seem most of all to dispose man to 
the fulfilment of the Divine law; wherefore obedience is accounted one of 
the degrees of humility, as stated above (<A Href="SS161.html#SSQ161OUTP1">Question [161]</a>, <A Href="SS161.html#SSQ161A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>); and the same 
apparently applies to meekness, the effect of which is that a man does 
not contradict the Divine Scriptures, as Augustine observes (De Doctr. 
Christ. ii, 7). Therefore it seems that the Decalogue should have 
contained precepts of humility and meekness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was stated in the foregoing Article that adultery is 
forbidden in the decalogue, because it is contrary to the love of our 
neighbor. But inordinateness of outward movements, which is contrary to 
modesty, is opposed to neighborly love: wherefore Augustine says in his 
Rule (Ep. ccxii): "In all your movements let nothing be done to offend 
the eye of any person whatever." Therefore it seems that this kind of 
inordinateness should also have been forbidden by a precept of the 
Decalogue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> suffices the authority of Scripture.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The virtues annexed to temperance may be considered in 
two ways: first, in themselves; secondly, in their effects. Considered in 
themselves they have no direct connection with the love of God or of our 
neighbor; rather do they regard a certain moderation of things pertaining 
to man himself. But considered in their effects, they may regard the love 
of God or of our neighbor: and in this respect the decalogue contains 
precepts that relate to the prohibition of the effects of the vices 
opposed to the parts of temperance. Thus the effect of anger, which is 
opposed to meekness, is sometimes that a man goes on to commit murder 
(and this is forbidden in the Decalogue), and sometimes that he refuses 
due honor to his parents, which may also be the result of pride, which 
leads many to transgress the precepts of the first table.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Pride is the beginning of sin, but it lies hidden in the 
heart; and its inordinateness is not perceived by all in common. Hence 
there was no place for its prohibition among the precepts of the 
Decalogue, which are like first self-evident principles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Those precepts which are essentially an inducement to the 
observance of the Law presuppose the Law to be already given, wherefore 
they cannot be first precepts of the Law so as to have a place in the 
Decalogue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[170] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Inordinate outward movement is not injurious to one's 
neighbor, if we consider the species of the act, as are  murder, 
adultery, and theft, which are forbidden in the decalogue; but only as 
being signs of an inward inordinateness, as stated above (<A Href="SS168.html#SSQ168OUTP1">Question [168]</a>, <A Href="SS168.html#SSQ168A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,3).
