OF SACRIFICE (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In due sequence we must consider those acts whereby external things are 
offered to God. These give rise to a twofold consideration: (1) Of things 
given to God by the faithful; (2) Of vows, whereby something is promised 
to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head we shall consider sacrifices, oblations, 
first-fruits, and tithes. About sacrifices there are four points of 
inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ85A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether offering a sacrifice to God is of the law of nature?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ85A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether sacrifice should be offered to God alone?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ85A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the offering of a sacrifice is a special act of virtue?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#SSQ85A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether all are bound to offer sacrifice?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that offering a sacrifice to God is not of the 
natural law. Things that are of the natural law are common among all men. 
Yet this is not the case with sacrifices: for we read of some, e.g. 
Melchisedech (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++14:18">Gn. 14:18</a>), offering bread and wine in sacrifice, and of 
certain animals being offered by some, and others by others. Therefore 
the offering of sacrifices is not of the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, things that are of the natural law were observed by all 
just men. Yet we do not read that Isaac offered sacrifice; nor that Adam 
did so, of whom nevertheless it is written (Wis. 10:2) that wisdom 
"brought him out of his sin." Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not 
of the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 5,19) that sacrifices are 
offered in signification of something. Now words which are chief among 
signs, as he again says (De Doctr. Christ. ii, 3), "signify, not by 
nature but by convention," according to the Philosopher (Peri Herm. i, 
2). Therefore sacrifices are not of  the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> At all times and among all nations there has always 
been the offering of sacrifices. Now that which is observed by all is 
seemingly natural. Therefore the offering of sacrifices is of the natural 
law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Natural reason tells man that he is subject to a higher 
being, on account of the defects which he perceives in himself, and in 
which he needs help and direction from someone above him: and whatever 
this superior being may be, it is known to all under the name of God. Now 
just as in natural things the lower are naturally subject to the higher, 
so too it is a dictate of natural reason in accordance with man's natural 
inclination that he should tender submission and honor, according to his 
mode, to that which is above man. Now the mode befitting to man is that 
he should employ sensible signs in order to signify anything, because he 
derives his knowledge from sensibles. Hence it is a dictate of natural 
reason that man should use certain sensibles, by offering them to God in 
sign of the subjection and honor due to Him, like those who make certain 
offerings to their lord in recognition of his authority. Now this is what 
we mean by a sacrifice, and consequently the offering of sacrifice is of 
the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS095.html#FSQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS095.html#FSQ95A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), certain things belong 
generically to the natural law, while their determination belongs to the 
positive law; thus the natural law requires that evildoers should be 
punished; but that this or that punishment should be inflicted on them is 
a matter determined by God or by man. In like manner the offering of 
sacrifice belongs generically to the natural law, and consequently all 
are agreed on this point, but the determination of sacrifices is 
established by God or by man, and this is the reason for their difference.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Adam, Isaac and other just men offered sacrifice to God in 
a manner befitting the times in which they lived, according to Gregory, 
who says (Moral. iv, 3) that in olden times original sin was remitted 
through the offering of sacrifices. Nor does Scripture mention all the 
sacrifices of the just, but only those that have something special 
connected with them. Perhaps the reason why we read of no sacrifice being 
offered by Adam may be that, as the origin of sin is ascribed to him, the 
origin of sanctification ought not to be represented as typified in him. 
Isaac was a type of Christ, being himself offered in sacrifice; and so 
there was no need that he should be represented as offering a sacrifice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is natural to man to express his ideas by signs, but the 
determination of those signs depends on man's pleasure.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sacrifice should not be offered to the most 
high God alone. Since sacrifice ought to be offered to God, it would seem 
that it ought to be offered to all such as are partakers of the Godhead. 
Now holy men are made "partakers of the Divine nature," according to 2 
Pt. 1:4; wherefore of them is it written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++81:6">Ps. 81:6</a>): "I have said, You 
are gods": and angels too are called "sons of God," according to Job 1:6. 
Thus sacrifice should be offered to all these.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater a person is the greater the honor due to him 
from man. Now the angels and saints are far greater than any earthly 
princes: and yet the subjects of the latter pay them much greater honor, 
by prostrating before them, and offering them gifts, than is implied by 
offering an animal or any other thing in sacrifice. Much more therefore 
may one offer sacrifice to the angels and saints.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, temples and altars are raised for the offering of 
sacrifices. Yet temples and altars are raised to angels and saints. 
Therefore sacrifices also may be offered to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ex++22:20">Ex. 22:20</a>): "He that sacrificeth to gods 
shall be put to death, save only to the Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), a sacrifice is offered in order 
that something may be represented. Now the sacrifice that is offered 
outwardly represents the inward spiritual sacrifice, whereby the soul 
offers itself to God according to Ps. 50:19, "A sacrifice to God is an 
afflicted spirit," since, as stated above (<A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81OUTP1">Question [81]</a>, <A Href="SS081.html#SSQ81A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>; <A Href="SS084.html#SSQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="SS084.html#SSQ84A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the 
outward acts of religion are directed to the inward acts. Again the soul 
offers itself in sacrifice to God as its beginning by creation, and its 
end by beatification: and according to the true faith God alone is the 
creator of our souls, as stated in the FP, Question [90], Article [3]; FS, Question [118], Article [2], 
while in Him alone the beatitude of our soul consists, as stated above 
(<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS003.html#FSQ3ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,7,8). Wherefore just as 
to God alone ought we to offer spiritual sacrifice, so too ought we to 
offer outward sacrifices to Him alone: even so "in our prayers and 
praises we proffer significant words to Him to Whom in our hearts we 
offer the things which we designate thereby," as Augustine states (De 
Civ. Dei x, 19). Moreover we find that in every country the people are 
wont to show the sovereign ruler some special sign of honor, and that if 
this be shown to anyone else, it is a crime of high-treason. Therefore, 
in the Divine law, the death punishment is assigned to those who offer 
Divine honor to another than God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The name of the Godhead is communicated to certain ones, 
not equally with God, but by participation; hence neither is equal honor 
due to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The offering of a sacrifice is measured not by the value of 
the animal killed, but by its signification, for it is done in honor of 
the sovereign Ruler of the whole universe. Wherefore, as Augustine says 
(De Civ. Dei x, 19), "the demons  rejoice, not in the stench of corpses, 
but in receiving divine honors."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei viii, 19), "we do not raise 
temples and priesthoods to the martyrs, because not they but their God is 
our God. Wherefore the priest says not: I offer sacrifice to thee, Peter 
or Paul. But we give thanks to God for their triumphs, and urge ourselves 
to imitate them."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the offering of sacrifice is a special act of virtue?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the offering of sacrifice is not a special act 
of virtue. Augustine says (De Civ. Dei x, 6): "A true sacrifice is any 
work done that we may cleave to God in holy fellowship." But not every 
good work is a special act of some definite virtue. Therefore the 
offering of sacrifice is not a special act of a definite virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the mortification of the body by fasting belongs to 
abstinence, by continence belongs to chastity, by martyrdom belongs to 
fortitude. Now all these things seem to be comprised in the offering of 
sacrifice, according to Rm. 12:1, "Present your bodies a living 
sacrifice." Again the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++13:16">Heb. 13:16</a>): "Do not forget to do 
good and to impart, for by such sacrifices God's favor is obtained." Now 
it belongs to charity, mercy and liberality to do good and to impart. 
Therefore the offering of sacrifice is not a special act of a definite 
virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a sacrifice is apparently anything offered to God. Now 
many things are offered to God, such as devotion, prayer, tithes, 
first-fruits, oblations, and holocausts. Therefore sacrifice does not 
appear to be a special act of a definite virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The law contains special precepts about sacrifices, as 
appears from the beginning of Leviticus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18ATHEP1">Articles [6]</a>,7), where an act of one 
virtue is directed to the end of another virtue it partakes somewhat of 
its species; thus when a man thieves in order to commit fornication, his 
theft assumes, in a sense, the deformity of fornication, so that even 
though it were not a sin otherwise, it would be a sin from the very fact 
that it was directed to fornication. Accordingly, sacrifice is a special 
act deserving of praise in that it is done out of reverence for God; and 
for this reason it belongs to a definite virtue, viz. religion. But it 
happens that the acts of the other virtues are directed to the reverence 
of God, as when a man gives alms of his own things for God's sake, or 
when a man subjects his own body to some affliction out of reverence for 
God; and in this way the acts also of other virtues may be called 
sacrifices. On the other hand there are acts that are not deserving of 
praise save through being done out of reverence for God: such acts are 
properly called sacrifices, and belong to the virtue of religion. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The very fact that we wish to cling to God in a spiritual 
fellowship pertains to reverence for God: and consequently the act of any 
virtue assumes the character of a sacrifice through being done in order 
that we may cling to God in holy fellowship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man's good is threefold. There is first his soul's good 
which is offered to God in a certain inward sacrifice by devotion, prayer 
and other like interior acts: and this is the principal sacrifice. The 
second is his body's good, which is, so to speak, offered to God in 
martyrdom, and abstinence or continency. The third is the good which 
consists of external things: and of these we offer a sacrifice to God, 
directly when we offer our possession to God immediately, and indirectly 
when we share them with our neighbor for God's sake.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A "sacrifice," properly speaking, requires that something 
be done to the thing which is offered to God, for instance animals were 
slain and burnt, the bread is broken, eaten, blessed. The very word 
signifies this, since "sacrifice" is so called because a man does 
something sacred [facit sacrum]. On the other hand an "oblation" is 
properly the offering of something to God even if nothing be done 
thereto, thus we speak of offering money or bread at the altar, and yet 
nothing is done to them. Hence every sacrifice is an oblation, but not 
conversely. "First-fruits" are oblations, because they were offered to 
God, according to Dt. 26, but they are not a sacrifice, because nothing 
sacred was done to them. "Tithes," however, are neither a sacrifice nor 
an oblation, properly speaking, because they are not offered immediately 
to God, but to the ministers of Divine worship.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that all are not bound to offer sacrifices. The 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++3:19">Rm. 3:19</a>): "What things soever the Law speaketh, it 
speaketh to them that are in the Law." Now the law of sacrifices was not 
given to all, but only to the Hebrew people. Therefore all are not bound 
to offer sacrifices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->

something. But not everyone is capable of understanding these 
significations. Therefore not all are bound to offer sacrifices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, priests [*'Sacerdotes': Those who give or administer 
sacred things (sacra dantes): cf. 1 Cor. 4:1] are so called because they 
offer sacrifice to God. But all are not priests. Therefore not all are 
bound to offer sacrifices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The offering of sacrifices of is of the natural law, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now all are bound to do that which is of the natural 
law. Therefore all are bound to offer  sacrifice to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sacrifice is twofold, as stated above (<A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). The first 
and principal is the inward sacrifice, which all are bound to offer, 
since all are obliged to offer to God a devout mind. The other is the 
outward sacrifice, and this again is twofold. There is a sacrifice which 
is deserving of praise merely through being offered to God in 
protestation of our subjection to God: and the obligation of offering 
this sacrifice was not the same for those under the New or the Old Law, 
as for those who were not under the Law. For those who are under the Law 
are bound to offer certain definite sacrifices according to the precepts 
of the Law, whereas those who were not under the Law were bound to 
perform certain outward actions in God's honor, as became those among 
whom they dwelt, but not definitely to this or that action. The other 
outward sacrifice is when the outward actions of the other virtues are 
performed out of reverence for God; some of which are a matter of 
precept; and to these all are bound, while others are works of 
supererogation, and to these all are not bound.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All were not bound to offer those particular sacrifices 
which were prescribed in the Law: but they were bound to some sacrifices 
inward or outward, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Though all do not know explicitly the power of the 
sacrifices, they know it implicitly, even as they have implicit faith, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, Articles 6,7).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[85] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The priests offer those sacrifices which are specially 
directed to the Divine worship, not only for themselves but also for 
others. But there are other sacrifices, which anyone can offer to God for 
himself as explained above (<A Href="SS085.html#SSQ85ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3).<br>
