<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that despair is not a sin. For every sin includes 
conversion to a mutable good, together with aversion from the immutable 
good, as Augustine states (De Lib. Arb. ii, 19). But despair includes no 
conversion to a mutable good. Therefore it is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which grows from a good root, seems to be no sin, 
because "a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++7:18">Mt. 7:18</a>). Now 
despair seems to grow from a good root, viz. fear of God, or from horror 
at the greatness of one's own sins. Therefore  despair is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if despair were a sin, it would be a sin also for the 
damned to despair. But this is not imputed to them as their fault but as 
part of their damnation. Therefore neither is it imputed to wayfarers as 
their fault, so that it is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which leads men to sin, seems not only to be a sin 
itself, but a source of sins. Now such is despair, for the Apostle says 
of certain men (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++4:19">Eph. 4:19</a>): "Who, despairing, have given themselves up to 
lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness and [Vulg.: 'unto'] 
covetousness." Therefore despair is not only a sin but also the origin of 
other sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. vi, 2) affirmation 
and negation in the intellect correspond to search and avoidance in the 
appetite; while truth and falsehood in the intellect correspond to good 
and evil in the appetite. Consequently every appetitive movement which is 
conformed to a true intellect, is good in itself, while every appetitive 
movement which is conformed to a false intellect is evil in itself and 
sinful. Now the true opinion of the intellect about God is that from Him 
comes salvation to mankind, and pardon to sinners, according to Ezech. 
18:23, "I desire not the death of the sinner, but that he should be 
converted, and live" [*Vulg.: 'Is it My will that a sinner should die . . 
. and not that he should be converted and live?' Cf. Ezech. 33:11]: while 
it is a false opinion that He refuses pardon to the repentant sinner, or 
that He does not turn sinners to Himself by sanctifying grace. Therefore, 
just as the movement of hope, which is in conformity with the true 
opinion, is praiseworthy and virtuous, so the contrary movement of 
despair, which is in conformity with the false opinion about God, is 
vicious and sinful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In every mortal sin there is, in some way, aversion from 
the immutable good, and conversion to a mutable good, but not always in 
the same way. Because, since the theological virtues have God for their 
object, the sins which are contrary to them, such as hatred of God, 
despair and unbelief, consist principally in aversion from the immutable 
good; but, consequently, they imply conversion to a mutable good, in so 
far as the soul that is a deserter from God, must necessarily turn to 
other things. Other sins, however, consist principally in conversion to a 
mutable good, and, consequently, in aversion from the immutable good: 
because the fornicator intends, not to depart from God, but to enjoy 
carnal pleasure, the result of which is that he departs from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A thing may grow from a virtuous root in two ways: first, 
directly and on the part of the virtue itself; even as an act proceeds 
from a habit: and in this way no sin can grow from a virtuous root, for 
in this sense Augustine declared (De Lib. Arb. ii, 18,19) that "no man 
makes evil use of virtue." Secondly, a thing proceeds from a virtue 
indirectly, or is occasioned by a virtue, and in this way nothing hinders 
a sin proceeding from a  virtue: thus sometimes men pride themselves of 
their virtues, according to Augustine (Ep. ccxi): "Pride lies in wait for 
good works that they may die." In this way fear of God or horror of one's 
own sins may lead to despair, in so far as man makes evil use of those 
good things, by allowing them to be an occasion of despair.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The damned are outside the pale of hope on account of the 
impossibility of returning to happiness: hence it is not imputed to them 
that they hope not, but it is a part of their damnation. Even so, it 
would be no sin for a wayfarer to despair of obtaining that which he had 
no natural capacity for obtaining, or which was not due to be obtained by 
him; for instance, if a physician were to despair of healing some sick 
man, or if anyone were to despair of ever becoming rich.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be no despair without unbelief. For 
the certainty of hope is derived from faith; and so long as the cause 
remains the effect is not done away. Therefore a man cannot lose the 
certainty of hope, by despairing, unless his faith be removed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to prefer one's own guilt to God's mercy and goodness, 
is to deny the infinity of God's goodness and mercy, and so savors of 
unbelief. But whoever despairs, prefers his own guilt to the Divine mercy 
and goodness, according to Gn. 4:13: "My iniquity is greater than that I 
may deserve pardon." Therefore whoever despairs, is an unbeliever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever falls into a condemned heresy, is an unbeliever. 
But he that despairs seems to fall into a condemned heresy, viz. that of 
the Novatians, who say that there is no pardon for sins after Baptism. 
Therefore it seems that whoever despairs, is an unbeliever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> If we remove that which follows, that which precedes 
remains. But hope follows faith, as stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Therefore 
when hope is removed, faith can remain; so that, not everyone who 
despairs, is an unbeliever.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Unbelief pertains to the intellect, but despair, to the 
appetite: and the intellect is about universals, while the appetite is 
moved in connection with particulars, since the appetitive movement is 
from the soul towards things, which, in themselves, are particular. Now 
it may happen that a man, while having a right opinion in the universal, 
is not rightly disposed as to his appetitive movement, his estimate being 
corrupted in a particular matter, because, in order to pass from the 
universal opinion to the appetite for a particular thing, it is necessary 
to have a particular estimate (De Anima iii, 2), just as it is impossible 
to infer a particular conclusion from an universal  proposition, except 
through the holding of a particular proposition. Hence it is that a man, 
while having right faith, in the universal, fails in an appetitive 
movement, in regard to some particular, his particular estimate being 
corrupted by a habit or a passion, just as the fornicator, by choosing 
fornication as a good for himself at this particular moment, has a 
corrupt estimate in a particular matter, although he retains the true 
universal estimate according to faith, viz. that fornication is a mortal 
sin. In the same way, a man while retaining in the universal, the true 
estimate of faith, viz. that there is in the Church the power of 
forgiving sins, may suffer a movement of despair, to wit, that for him, 
being in such a state, there is no hope of pardon, his estimate being 
corrupted in a particular matter. In this way there can be despair, just 
as there can be other mortal sins, without belief.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The effect is done away, not only when the first cause is 
removed, but also when the secondary cause is removed. Hence the movement 
of hope can be done away, not only by the removal of the universal 
estimate of faith, which is, so to say, the first cause of the certainty 
of hope, but also by the removal of the particular estimate, which is the 
secondary cause, as it were.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If anyone were to judge, in universal, that God's mercy is 
not infinite, he would be an unbeliever. But he who despairs judges not 
thus, but that, for him in that state, on account of some particular 
disposition, there is no hope of the Divine mercy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same answer applies to the Third Objection, since the Novatians 
denied, in universal, that there is remission of sins in the Church.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether despair is the greatest of sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that despair is not the greatest of sins. For there 
can be despair without unbelief, as stated above (<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But unbelief is 
the greatest of sins because it overthrows the foundation of the 
spiritual edifice. Therefore despair is not the greatest of sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a greater evil is opposed to a greater good, as the 
Philosopher states (Ethic. viii, 10). But charity is greater than hope, 
according to 1 Cor. 13:13. Therefore hatred of God is a greater sin than 
despair.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in the sin of despair there is nothing but inordinate 
aversion from God: whereas in other sins there is not only inordinate 
aversion from God, but also an inordinate conversion. Therefore the sin 
of despair is not more but less grave than other sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> An incurable sin seems to be most grievous, according 
to Jer. 30:12: "Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound is very grievous." Now 
the sin of despair is incurable, according to Jer. 15:18: "My wound is 
desperate so as to refuse to be healed." [*Vulg.: 'Why is my wound,' 
etc.] Therefore despair is a most grievous sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Those sins which are contrary to the theological virtues 
are in themselves more grievous than others: because, since the 
theological virtues have God for their object, the sins which are opposed 
to them imply aversion from God directly and principally. Now every 
mortal sin takes its principal malice and gravity from the fact of its 
turning away from God, for if it were possible to turn to a mutable good, 
even inordinately, without turning away from God, it would not be a 
mortal sin. Consequently a sin which, first and of its very nature, 
includes aversion from God, is most grievous among mortal sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now unbelief, despair and hatred of God are opposed to the theological 
virtues: and among them, if we compare hatred of God and unbelief to 
despair, we shall find that, in themselves, that is, in respect of their 
proper species, they are more grievous. For unbelief is due to a man not 
believing God's own truth; while the hatred of God arises from man's will 
being opposed to God's goodness itself; whereas despair consists in a man 
ceasing to hope for a share of God's goodness. Hence it is clear that 
unbelief and hatred of God are against God as He is in Himself, while 
despair is against Him, according as His good is partaken of by us. 
Wherefore strictly speaking it is more grievous sin to disbelieve God's 
truth, or to hate God, than not to hope to receive glory from Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, despair be compared to the other two sins from our point of 
view, then despair is more dangerous, since hope withdraws us from evils 
and induces us to seek for good things, so that when hope is given up, 
men rush headlong into sin, and are drawn away from good works. Wherefore 
a gloss on Prov. 24:10, "If thou lose hope being weary in the day of 
distress, thy strength shall be diminished," says: "Nothing is more 
hateful than despair, for the man that has it loses his constancy both in 
the every day toils of this life, and, what is worse, in the battle of 
faith." And Isidore says (De Sum. Bono ii, 14): "To commit a crime is to 
kill the soul, but to despair is to fall into hell."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether despair arises from sloth?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that despair does not arise from sloth. Because 
different causes do not give rise to one same effect. Now despair of the 
future life arises from lust, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45). 
Therefore it does not arise from sloth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as despair is contrary to hope, so is sloth 
contrary to spiritual joy. But spiritual joy arises from hope, according 
to Rm. 12:12, "rejoicing in hope." Therefore sloth  arises from despair, 
and not vice versa.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contrary effects have contrary causes. Now hope, the 
contrary of which is despair, seems to proceed from the consideration of 
Divine favors, especially the Incarnation, for Augustine says (De Trin. 
xiii, 10): "Nothing was so necessary to raise our hope, than that we 
should be shown how much God loves us. Now what greater proof could we 
have of this than that God's Son should deign to unite Himself to our 
nature?" Therefore despair arises rather from the neglect of the above 
consideration than from sloth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory (Moral. xxxi, 45) reckons despair among the 
effects of sloth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="SS017.html#SSQ17A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40OUTP1">Question [40]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS040.html#FSQ40A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the 
object of hope is a good, difficult but possible to obtain by oneself or 
by another. Consequently the hope of obtaining happiness may be lacking 
in a person in two ways: first, through his not deeming it an arduous 
good; secondly, through his deeming it impossible to obtain either by 
himself, or by another. Now, the fact that spiritual goods taste good to 
us no more, or seem to be goods of no great account, is chiefly due to 
our affections being infected with the love of bodily pleasures, among 
which, sexual pleasures hold the first place: for the love of those 
pleasures leads man to have a distaste for spiritual things, and not to 
hope for them as arduous goods. In this way despair is caused by lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, the fact that a man deems an arduous good impossible 
to obtain, either by himself or by another, is due to his being over 
downcast, because when this state of mind dominates his affections, it 
seems to him that he will never be able to rise to any good. And since 
sloth is a sadness that casts down the spirit, in this way despair is 
born of sloth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now this is the proper object of hope---that the thing is possible, 
because the good and the arduous regard other passions also. Hence 
despair is born of sloth in a more special way: though it may arise from 
lust, for the reason given above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Rhet. i, 11), just as hope 
gives rise to joy, so, when a man is joyful he has greater hope: and, 
accordingly, those who are sorrowful fall the more easily into despair, 
according to 2 Cor. 2:7: "Lest . . . such an one be swallowed up by 
overmuch sorrow." Yet, since the object of hope is good, to which the 
appetite tends naturally, and which it shuns, not naturally but only on 
account of some supervening obstacle, it follows that, more directly, 
hope gives birth to joy, while on the contrary despair is born of sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[20] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This very neglect to consider the Divine favors arises from 
sloth. For when a man is influenced by a certain  passion he considers 
chiefly the things which pertain to that passion: so that a man who is 
full of sorrow does not easily think of great and joyful things, but only 
of sad things, unless by a great effort he turn his thoughts away from 
sadness.<br>
