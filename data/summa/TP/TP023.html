</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now come to consider whether adoption befits Christ: and under 
this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ23A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is fitting that God should adopt sons?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ23A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this is fitting to God the Father alone?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ23A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is proper to man to be adopted to the sonship of God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ23A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether Christ can be called the adopted Son?

<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not fitting that God should adopt sons. 
For, as jurists say, no one adopts anyone but a stranger as his son. But 
no one is a stranger in relation to God, Who is the Creator of all. 
Therefore it seems unfitting that God should adopt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, adoption seems to have been introduced in default of 
natural sonship. But in God there is natural sonship, as set down in the 
FP, Question [27], Article [2]. Therefore it is unfitting that God should adopt. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the purpose of adopting anyone is that he may succeed, 
as heir, the person who adopts him. But it does not seem possible for 
anyone to succeed God as heir, for He can never die. Therefore it is 
unfitting that God should adopt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++1:5">Eph. 1:5</a>) that "He hath predestinated us 
unto the adoption of children of God." But the predestination of God is 
not ineffectual. Therefore God does adopt some as His sons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A man adopts someone as his son forasmuch as out of 
goodness he admits him as heir to his estate. Now God is infinitely good: 
for which reason He admits His creatures to a participation of good 
things; especially rational creatures, who forasmuch as they are made to 
the image of God, are capable of Divine beatitude. And this consists in 
the enjoyment of God, by which also God Himself is happy and rich in 
Himself---that is, in the enjoyment of Himself. Now a man's inheritance 
is that which makes him rich. Wherefore, inasmuch as God, of His 
goodness, admits men to the inheritance of beatitude, He is said to adopt 
them. Moreover Divine exceeds human adoption, forasmuch as God, by 
bestowing His grace, makes man whom He adopts worthy to receive the 
heavenly inheritance; whereas man does not make him worthy whom he 
adopts; but rather in adopting him he chooses one who is already worthy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Considered in his nature man is not a stranger in respect 
to God, as to the natural gifts bestowed on him: but he is as to the 
gifts of grace and glory; in regard to which he is adopted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Man works in order to supply his wants: not so God, Who 
works in order to communicate to others the abundance of His perfection. 
Wherefore, as by the work of creation the Divine goodness is communicated 
to all creatures in a certain likeness, so by the work of adoption the 
likeness of natural sonship is communicated to men, according to Rm. 
8:29: "Whom He foreknew . . . to be made conformable to the image of His 
Son."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Spiritual goods can be possessed by many at the same time; 
not so material goods. Wherefore none can receive a material inheritance 
except the successor of a deceased person: whereas all receive the 
spiritual inheritance at the same time in its entirety without detriment 
to the ever-living Father.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it might be said that God ceases to be, according as He is in us by 
faith, so as to begin to be in us by vision, as a gloss says on Rm. 8:17: 
"If sons, heirs also."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that the whole Trinity should adopt. For 
adoption is said of God in likeness to human custom. But  among men those 
only adopt who can beget: and in God this can be applied only to the 
Father. Therefore in God the Father alone can adopt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by adoption men become the brethren of Christ, according 
to Rm. 8:29: "That He might be the first-born among many brethren." Now 
brethren are the sons of the same father; wherefore our Lord says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++20:17">Jn. 20:17</a>): "I ascend to My Father and to your Father." Therefore Christ's 
Father alone has adopted sons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++4:4,5,6">Gal. 4:4,5,6</a>): "God sent His Son . . . 
that we might receive the adoption of sons. And because you are sons of 
God, God hath sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying: 'Abba' 
[Father]." Therefore it belongs to Him to adopt, Who has the Son and the 
Holy Ghost. But this belongs to the Father alone. Therefore it befits the 
Father alone to adopt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It belongs to Him to adopt us as sons, Whom we can call 
Father; whence it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:15">Rm. 8:15</a>): "You have received the spirit of 
adoption of sons, whereby we cry: 'Abba' [Father]." But when we say to 
God, "Our Father," we address the whole Trinity: as is the case with the 
other names which are said of God in respect of creatures, as stated in 
the FP, Question [33], Article [3], Objection [1]; cf. FP, Question [45], Article [6]. Therefore to adopt is 
befitting to the whole Trinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There is this difference between an adopted son of God 
and the natural Son of God, that the latter is "begotten not made"; 
whereas the former is made, according to Jn. 1:12: "He gave them power to 
be made the sons of God." Yet sometimes the adopted son is said to be 
begotten, by reason of the spiritual regeneration which is by grace, not 
by nature; wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?James+1:18">James 1:18</a>): "Of His own will hath He 
begotten us by the word of truth." Now although, in God, to beget belongs 
to the Person of the Father, yet to produce any effect in creatures is 
common to the whole Trinity, by reason of the oneness of their Nature: 
since, where there is one nature, there must needs be one power and one 
operation: whence our Lord says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++5:19">Jn. 5:19</a>): "What things soever the 
Father doth, these the Son also doth in like manner." Therefore it 
belongs to the whole Trinity to adopt men as sons of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All human individuals are not of one individual nature, so 
that there need be one operation and one effect of them all, as is the 
case in God. Consequently in this respect no comparison is possible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By adoption we are made the brethren of Christ, as having 
with Him the same Father: Who, nevertheless, is His Father in one way, 
and ours in another. Whence pointedly our Lord says, separately, "My 
Father," and "Your Father" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++20:17">Jn. 20:17</a>). For He is Christ's Father by 
natural generation; and this is proper to Him: whereas He is our Father 
by a voluntary operation, which is common to Him and to the Son and Holy 
Ghost: so that Christ is not the Son of the whole Trinity, as we are. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP023.html#TPQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), adoptive sonship is a certain 
likeness of the eternal Sonship: just as all that takes place in time is 
a certain likeness of what has been from eternity. Now man is likened to 
the splendor of the Eternal Son by reason of the light of grace which is 
attributed to the Holy Ghost. Therefore adoption, though common to the 
whole Trinity, is appropriated to the Father as its author; to the Son, 
as its exemplar; to the Holy Ghost, as imprinting on us the likeness of 
this exemplar.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is proper to the rational nature to be adopted?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not proper to the rational nature to be 
adopted. For God is not said to be the Father of the rational creature, 
save by adoption. But God is called the Father even of the irrational 
creature, according to Job 38:28: "Who is father of the rain? Or who 
begot the drops of dew?" Therefore it is not proper to the rational 
creature to be adopted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by reason of adoption some are called sons of God. But 
to be sons of God seems to be properly attributed by the Scriptures to 
the angels; according to Job 1:6: "On a certain day when the sons of God 
came to stand before the Lord." Therefore it is not proper to the 
rational creature to be adopted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever is proper to a nature, belongs to all that have 
that nature: just as risibility belongs to all men. But to be adopted 
does not belong to every rational nature. Therefore it is not proper to 
human nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Adopted sons are the "heirs of God," as is stated Rm. 
8:17. But such an inheritance belongs to none but the rational nature. 
Therefore it is proper to the rational nature to be adopted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP023.html#TPQ23A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3), the sonship of adoption is 
a certain likeness of natural sonship. Now the Son of God proceeds 
naturally from the Father as the Intellectual Word, in oneness of nature 
with the Father. To this Word, therefore, something may be likened in 
three ways. First, on the part of the form but not on the part of its 
intelligibility: thus the form of a house already built is like the 
mental word of the builder in its specific form, but not in 
intelligibility, because the material form of a house is not 
intelligible, as it was in the mind of the builder. In this way every 
creature is like the Eternal Word; since it was made through the Word. 
Secondly, the creature is likened to the Word, not only as to its form, 
but also as to its intelligibility: thus the knowledge which is begotten 
in the disciple's mind is likened to the word in the mind of the master. 
In this way the rational creature, even in its nature, is likened to the 
Word of God. Thirdly, a creature is likened to the Eternal Word, as to 
the oneness of the Word with the Father, which is by reason of grace and 
charity: wherefore our Lord prays (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn+++17:21,22">Jn.  17:21,22</a>): "That they may be one 
in Us . . . as We also are one." And this likeness perfects the adoption: 
for to those who are thus like Him the eternal inheritance is due. It is 
therefore clear that to be adopted belongs to the rational creature 
alone: not indeed to all, but only to those who have charity; which is 
"poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++5:5">Rm. 5:5</a>); for which 
reason (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:15">Rm. 8:15</a>) the Holy Ghost is called "the Spirit of adoption of 
sons."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God is called the Father of the irrational creature, not 
properly speaking, by reason of adoption, but by reason of creation; 
according to the first-mentioned participation of likeness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Angels are called sons of God by adoptive sonship, not that 
it belongs to them first; but because they were the first to receive the 
adoption of sons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Adoption is a property resulting not from nature, but from 
grace, of which the rational nature is capable. Therefore it need not 
belong to every rational nature: but every rational creature must needs 
be capable of adoption.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ as man is the adopted Son of God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ as man is the adopted Son of God. For 
Hilary says (De Trin. ii) speaking of Christ: "The dignity of power is 
not forfeited when carnal humanity [*Some editions read 
'humilitas'---'the humility or lowliness of the flesh'] is adopted." 
Therefore Christ as man is the adopted Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Praedest. Sanct. xv) that "by the 
same grace that Man is Christ, as from the birth of faith every man is a 
Christian." But other men are Christians by the grace of adoption. 
Therefore this Man is Christ by adoption: and consequently He would seem 
to be an adopted son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ, as man, is a servant. But it is of greater 
dignity to be an adopted son than to be a servant. Therefore much more is 
Christ, as man, an adopted Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Incarn. viii): "We do not call an 
adopted son a natural son: the natural son is a true son." But Christ is 
the true and natural Son of God, according to 1 Jn. 5:20: "That we may . 
. . be in His true Son, Jesus Christ." Therefore Christ, as Man, is not 
an adopted Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Sonship belongs properly to the hypostasis or person, not 
to the nature; whence in the FP, Question [32], Article [3] we have stated that 
Filiation is a personal property. Now in Christ there is no other than 
the uncreated person or hypostasis, to Whom it belongs by nature to be 
the Son. But it has been said above (<A Href="TP023.html#TPQ23A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2), that the sonship of 
adoption is a participated likeness of natural sonship: nor can a thing 
be said to participate in what it has  essentially. Therefore Christ, Who 
is the natural Son of God, can nowise be called an adopted Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But according to those who suppose two persons or two hypostases or two 
supposita in Christ, no reason prevents Christ being called the adopted 
Son of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As sonship does not properly belong to the nature, so 
neither does adoption. Consequently, when it is said that "carnal 
humanity is adopted," the expression is metaphorical: and adoption is 
used to signify the union of human nature to the Person of the Son.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This comparison of Augustine is to be referred to the 
principle because, to wit, just as it is granted to any man without 
meriting it to be a Christian, so did it happen that this man without 
meriting it was Christ. But there is a difference on the part of the 
term: because by the grace of union Christ is the natural Son; whereas 
another man by habitual grace is an adopted son. Yet habitual grace in 
Christ does not make one who was not a son to be an adopted son, but is a 
certain effect of Filiation in the soul of Christ, according to Jn. 1:14: 
"We saw His glory . . . as it were of the Only-begotten of the Father; 
full of grace and truth."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[23] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To be a creature, as also to be subservient or subject to 
God, regards not only the person, but also the nature: but this cannot be 
said of sonship. Wherefore the comparison does not hold.<br>
