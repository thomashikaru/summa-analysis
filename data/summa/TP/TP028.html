<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Mother of God was not a virgin in 
conceiving Christ. For no child having father and mother is conceived by 
a virgin mother. But Christ is said to have had not only a mother, but 
also a father, according to Lk. 2:33: "His father and mother were 
wondering at those things which were spoken concerning Him": and further 
on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++2:48">Lk. 2:48</a>) in the same chapter she says: "Behold I and Thy father 
[Vulg.: 'Thy father and I'] have sought Thee sorrowing." Therefore Christ 
was not conceived of a virgin mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++1">Mt. 1</a>) it is proved that Christ was the Son of Abraham 
and David, through Joseph being descended from David. But this proof 
would have availed nothing if Joseph were not the father of Christ. 
Therefore it seems that Christ's Mother conceived Him of the seed of 
Joseph; and consequently that she was not a virgin in conceiving Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++4:4">Gal. 4:4</a>): "God sent His Son, made of a 
woman." But according to the customary mode of speaking, the term "woman" 
applies to one who is known of a man. Therefore Christ was not conceived 
by a virgin mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, things of the same species have the same mode of 
generation: since generation is specified by its terminus just as are 
other motions. But Christ belonged to the same species as other men, 
according to Phil. 2:7: "Being made in the likeness of men, and in habit 
found as a man." Since therefore other men are begotten of the mingling 
of male and female, it seems that Christ was begotten in the same manner; 
and that consequently He was not conceived of a virgin mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, every natural form has its determinate matter, outside 
which it cannot be. But the matter of human form appears to be the semen 
of male and female. If therefore Christ's body was not conceived of the 
semen of male and female, it would not have been truly a human body; 
which cannot be asserted. It seems therefore that He was not conceived of 
a virgin mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++7:14">Is. 7:14</a>): "Behold a virgin shall 
conceive."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We must confess simply that the Mother of Christ was a 
virgin in conceiving for to deny this belongs to the heresy of the 
Ebionites and Cerinthus, who held Christ to be a mere man, and maintained 
that He was born of both sexes.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is fitting for four reasons that Christ should be born of a virgin. 
First, in order to maintain the dignity or the Father Who sent Him. For 
since Christ is the true and natural Son of God, it  was not fitting that 
He should have another father than God: lest the dignity belonging to God 
be transferred to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this was befitting to a property of the Son Himself, Who is 
sent. For He is the Word of God: and the word is conceived without any 
interior corruption: indeed, interior corruption is incompatible with 
perfect conception of the word. Since therefore flesh was so assumed by 
the Word of God, as to be the flesh of the Word of God, it was fitting 
that it also should be conceived without corruption of the mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this was befitting to the dignity of Christ's humanity in which 
there could be no sin, since by it the sin of the world was taken away, 
according to Jn. 1:29: "Behold the Lamb of God" (i.e. the Lamb without 
stain) "who taketh away the sin of the world." Now it was not possible in 
a nature already corrupt, for flesh to be born from sexual intercourse 
without incurring the infection of original sin. Whence Augustine says 
(De Nup. et Concup. i): "In that union," viz. the marriage of Mary and 
Joseph, "the nuptial intercourse alone was lacking: because in sinful 
flesh this could not be without fleshly concupiscence which arises from 
sin, and without which He wished to be conceived, Who was to be without 
sin."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, on account of the very end of the Incarnation of Christ, which 
was that men might be born again as sons of God, "not of the will of the 
flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++1:13">Jn. 1:13</a>), i.e. of the power 
of God, of which fact the very conception of Christ was to appear as an 
exemplar. Whence Augustine says (De Sanct. Virg.): "It behooved that our 
Head, by a notable miracle, should be born, after the flesh, of a virgin, 
that He might thereby signify that His members would be born, after the 
Spirit, of a virgin Church."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Bede says on Lk. 1:33: Joseph is called the father of 
the Saviour, not that he really was His father, as the Photinians 
pretended: but that he was considered by men to be so, for the 
safeguarding of Mary's good name. Wherefore Luke adds (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++3:23">Lk. 3:23</a>): "Being, 
as it was supposed, the son of Joseph."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Or, according to Augustine (De Cons. Evang. ii), Joseph is called the 
father of Christ just as "he is called the husband of Mary, without 
fleshly mingling, by the mere bond of marriage: being thereby united to 
Him much more closely than if he were adopted from another family. 
Consequently that Christ was not begotten of Joseph by fleshly union is 
no reason why Joseph should not be called His father; since he would be 
the father even of an adopted son not born of his wife."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Jerome says on Mt. 1:18: "Though Joseph was not the 
father of our Lord and Saviour, the order of His genealogy is traced down 
to Joseph"---first, because "the Scriptures are not wont to trace the 
female line in genealogies": secondly, "Mary and Joseph were of the same 
tribe"; wherefore by law he was bound to  take her as being of his kin. 
Likewise, as Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i), "it was befitting to 
trace the genealogy down to Joseph, lest in that marriage any slight 
should be offered to the male sex, which is indeed the stronger: for 
truth suffered nothing thereby, since both Joseph and Mary were of the 
family of David."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the gloss says on this passage, the word "'mulier,' is 
here used instead of 'femina,' according to the custom of the Hebrew 
tongue: which applies the term signifying woman to those of the female 
sex who are virgins."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument is true of those things which come into 
existence by the way of nature: since nature, just as it is fixed to one 
particular effect, so it is determinate to one mode of producing that 
effect. But as the supernatural power of God extends to the infinite: 
just as it is not determinate to one effect, so neither is it determinate 
to one mode of producing any effect whatever. Consequently, just as it 
was possible for the first man to be produced, by the Divine power, "from 
the slime of the earth," so too was it possible for Christ's body to be 
made, by Divine power, from a virgin without the seed of the male.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> According to the Philosopher (De Gener. Animal. i, ii, iv), 
in conception the seed of the male is not by way of matter, but by way of 
agent: and the female alone supplies the matter. Wherefore though the 
seed of the male was lacking in Christ's conception, it does not follow 
that due matter was lacking.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if the seed of the male were the matter of the fetus in animal 
conception, it is nevertheless manifest that it is not a matter remaining 
under one form, but subject to transformation. And though the natural 
power cannot transmute other than determinate matter to a determinate 
form; nevertheless the Divine power, which is infinite, can transmute all 
matter to any form whatsoever. Consequently, just as it transmuted the 
slime of the earth into Adam's body, so could it transmute the matter 
supplied by His Mother into Christ's body, even though it were not the 
sufficient matter for a natural conception.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Christ's Mother was a virgin in His birth?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Mother was not a virgin in His Birth. 
For Ambrose says on Lk. 2:23: "He who sanctified a strange womb, for the 
birth of a prophet, He it is who opened His Mother's womb, that He might 
go forth unspotted." But opening of the womb excludes virginity. 
Therefore Christ's Mother was not a virgin in His Birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing should have taken place in the mystery of 
Christ, which would make His body to seem unreal. Now it seems to pertain 
not to a true but to an unreal body, to be able to go through a closed 
passage; since two bodies cannot be in one place  at the same time. It 
was therefore unfitting that Christ's body should come forth from His 
Mother's closed womb: and consequently that she should remain a virgin in 
giving birth to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as Gregory says in the Homily for the octave of Easter 
[*xxvi in Evang.], that by entering after His Resurrection where the 
disciples were gathered, the doors being shut, our Lord "showed that His 
body was the same in nature but differed in glory": so that it seems that 
to go through a closed passage pertains to a glorified body. But Christ's 
body was not glorified in its conception, but was passible, having "the 
likeness of sinful flesh," as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:3">Rm. 8:3</a>). Therefore He 
did not come forth through the closed womb of the Virgin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> In a sermon of the Council of Ephesus (P. III, Cap. ix) 
it is said: "After giving birth, nature knows not a virgin: but grace 
enhances her fruitfulness, and effects her motherhood, while in no way 
does it injure her virginity." Therefore Christ's Mother was a virgin 
also in giving birth to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Without any doubt whatever we must assert that the Mother 
of Christ was a virgin even in His Birth: for the prophet says not only: 
"Behold a virgin shall conceive," but adds: "and shall bear a son." This 
indeed was befitting for three reasons. First, because this was in 
keeping with a property of Him whose Birth is in question, for He is the 
Word of God. For the word is not only conceived in the mind without 
corruption, but also proceeds from the mind without corruption. Wherefore 
in order to show that body to be the body of the very Word of God, it was 
fitting that it should be born of a virgin incorrupt. Whence in the 
sermon of the Council of Ephesus (quoted above) we read: "Whosoever 
brings forth mere flesh, ceases to be a virgin. But since she gave birth 
to the Word made flesh, God safeguarded her virginity so as to manifest 
His Word, by which Word He thus manifested Himself: for neither does our 
word, when brought forth, corrupt the mind; nor does God, the substantial 
Word, deigning to be born, destroy virginity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this is fitting as regards the effect of Christ's Incarnation: 
since He came for this purpose, that He might take away our corruption. 
Wherefore it is unfitting that in His Birth He should corrupt His 
Mother's virginity. Thus Augustine says in a sermon on the Nativity of 
Our Lord: "It was not right that He who came to heal corruption, should 
by His advent violate integrity."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, it was fitting that He Who commanded us to honor our father and 
mother should not in His Birth lessen the honor due to His Mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Ambrose says this in expounding the evangelist's quotation 
from the Law: "Every male opening the womb shall be called holy to the 
Lord." This, says Bede, "is said in regard to the wonted manner of birth; 
not that we are to believe that our Lord in coming forth violated the 
abode of her sacred womb, which  His entrance therein had hallowed." 
Wherefore the opening here spoken of does not imply the unlocking of the 
enclosure of virginal purity; but the mere coming forth of the infant 
from the maternal womb.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Christ wished so to show the reality of His body, as to 
manifest His Godhead at the same time. For this reason He mingled 
wondrous with lowly things. Wherefore, to show that His body was real, He 
was born of a woman. But in order to manifest His Godhead, He was born of 
a virgin, for "such a Birth befits a God," as Ambrose says in the 
Christmas hymn.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some have held that Christ, in His Birth, assumed the gift 
of "subtlety," when He came forth from the closed womb of a virgin; and 
that He assumed the gift of "agility" when with dry feet He walked on the 
sea. But this is not consistent with what has been decided above (<A Href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>). 
For these gifts of a glorified body result from an overflow of the soul's 
glory on to the body, as we shall explain further on, in treating of 
glorified bodies (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP082.html#XPQ82OUTP1">Question [82]</a>): and it has been said above (<A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>, <A Href="TP013.html#TPQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1; <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1">Question [16]</a>, <A Href="TP016.html#TPQ16A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2) that before His Passion Christ "allowed His flesh 
to do and to suffer what was proper to it" (Damascene, De Fide Orth. 
iii): nor was there such an overflow of glory from His soul on to His 
body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore say that all these things took place miraculously by 
Divine power. Whence Augustine says (Sup. Joan. Tract. 121): "To the 
substance of a body in which was the Godhead closed doors were no 
obstacle. For truly He had power to enter in by doors not open, in Whose 
Birth His Mother's virginity remained inviolate." And Dionysius says in 
an epistle (Ad Caium iv) that "Christ excelled man in doing that which is 
proper to man: this is shown in His supernatural conception, of a virgin, 
and in the unstable waters bearing the weight of earthly feet."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's Mother did not remain a virgin after 
His Birth. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++1:18">Mt. 1:18</a>): "Before Joseph and Mary came 
together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost." Now the Evangelist 
would not have said this---"before they came together"---unless he were 
certain of their subsequent coming together; for no one says of one who 
does not eventually dine "before he dines" (cf. Jerome, Contra Helvid.). 
It seems, therefore, that the Blessed Virgin subsequently had intercourse 
with Joseph; and consequently that she did not remain a virgin after 
(Christ's) Birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the same passage (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++1:20">Mt. 1:20</a>) are related the words of 
the angel to Joseph: "Fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife." But 
marriage is consummated by carnal intercourse. Therefore it seems that 
this must have at some time taken place between Mary and Joseph: and 
that, consequently she did not remain a virgin after (Christ's) Birth. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, again in the same passage a little further on (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++1:24,25">Mt. 1:24,25</a>) we read: "And" (Joseph) "took unto him his wife; and he knew her 
not till she brought forth her first-born Son." Now this conjunction 
"till" is wont to designate a fixed time, on the completion of which that 
takes place which previously had not taken place. And the verb "knew" 
refers here to knowledge by intercourse (cf. Jerome, Contra Helvid.); 
just as (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++4:1">Gn. 4:1</a>) it is said that "Adam knew his wife." Therefore it 
seems that after (Christ's) Birth, the Blessed Virgin was known by 
Joseph; and, consequently, that she did not remain a virgin after the 
Birth (of Christ).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "first-born" can only be said of one who has brothers 
afterwards: wherefore (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++8:29">Rm. 8:29</a>): "Whom He foreknew, He also 
predestinated to be made conformable to the image of His Son; that He 
might be the first-born among many brethren." But the evangelist calls 
Christ the first-born by His Mother. Therefore she had other children 
after Christ. And therefore it seems that Christ's Mother did not remain 
a virgin after His Birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++2:12">Jn. 2:12</a>): "After this He went down to 
Capharnaum, He"---that is, Christ---"and His Mother and His brethren." 
But brethren are those who are begotten of the same parent. Therefore it 
seems that the Blessed Virgin had other sons after Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++27:55,56">Mt. 27:55,56</a>): "There were there"---that 
is, by the cross of Christ---"many women afar off, who had followed Jesus 
from Galilee, ministering unto Him; among whom was Mary Magdalen, and 
Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of 
Zebedee." Now this Mary who is called "the mother of James and Joseph" 
seems to have been also the Mother of Christ; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++19:25">Jn. 19:25</a>) that "there stood by the cross of Jesus, Mary His Mother." 
Therefore it seems that Christ's Mother did not remain a virgin after His 
Birth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Ezech. 44:2): "This gate shall be shut, 
it shall not be opened, and no man shall pass through it; because the 
Lord the God of Israel hath entered in by it." Expounding these words, 
Augustine says in a sermon (De Annunt. Dom. iii): "What means this closed 
gate in the House of the Lord, except that Mary is to be ever inviolate? 
What does it mean that 'no man shall pass through it,' save that Joseph 
shall not know her? And what is this---'The Lord alone enters in and 
goeth out by it'---except that the Holy Ghost shall impregnate her, and 
that the Lord of angels shall be born of her? And what means this---'it 
shall be shut for evermore'---but that Mary is a virgin before His Birth, 
a virgin in His Birth, and a virgin after His Birth?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Without any hesitation we must abhor the error of 
Helvidius, who dared to assert that Christ's Mother, after His Birth, was 
carnally known by Joseph, and bore other children. For, in the first 
place, this is derogatory to Christ's perfection: for as He is in His 
Godhead the Only-Begotten of the Father, being thus  His Son in every 
respect perfect, so it was becoming that He should be the Only-begotten 
son of His Mother, as being her perfect offspring.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this error is an insult to the Holy Ghost, whose "shrine" was 
the virginal womb [*"Sacrarium Spiritus Sancti" (Office of B. M. V., Ant. 
ad Benedictus, T. P.)], wherein He had formed the flesh of Christ: 
wherefore it was unbecoming that it should be desecrated by intercourse 
with man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this is derogatory to the dignity and holiness of God's Mother: 
for thus she would seem to be most ungrateful, were she not content with 
such a Son; and were she, of her own accord, by carnal intercourse to 
forfeit that virginity which had been miraculously preserved in her.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Fourthly, it would be tantamount to an imputation of extreme presumption 
in Joseph, to assume that he attempted to violate her whom by the angel's 
revelation he knew to have conceived by the Holy Ghost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore simply assert that the Mother of God, as she was a 
virgin in conceiving Him and a virgin in giving Him birth, did she remain 
a virgin ever afterwards.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Jerome says (Contra Helvid. i): "Although this particle 
'before' often indicates a subsequent event, yet we must observe that it 
not infrequently points merely to some thing previously in the mind: nor 
is there need that what was in the mind take place eventually, since 
something may occur to prevent its happening. Thus if a man say: 'Before 
I dined in the port, I set sail,' we do not understand him to have dined 
in port after he set sail: but that his mind was set on dining in port." 
In like manner the evangelist says: "Before they came together" Mary "was 
found with child, of the Holy Ghost," not that they came together 
afterwards: but that, when it seemed that they would come together, this 
was forestalled through her conceiving by the Holy Ghost, the result 
being that afterwards they did not come together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i): "The Mother of 
God is called (Joseph's) wife from the first promise of her espousals, 
whom he had not known nor ever was to know by carnal intercourse." For, 
as Ambrose says on Lk. 1:27: "The fact of her marriage is declared, not 
to insinuate the loss of virginity, but to witness to the reality of the 
union."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some have said that this is not to be understood of carnal 
knowledge, but of acquaintance. Thus Chrysostom says [*Opus Imperf. in 
Matth., Hom. 1: among the spurious works ascribed to Chrysostom] that 
"Joseph did not know her, until she gave birth, being unaware of her 
dignity: but after she had given birth, then did he know her. Because by 
reason of her child she surpassed the whole world in beauty and dignity: 
since she alone in the narrow abode of her womb received Him Whom the 
world cannot contain." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others again refer this to knowledge by sight. For as, while Moses was 
speaking with God, his face was so bright "that the children of Israel 
could not steadfastly behold it"; so Mary, while being "overshadowed" by 
the brightness of the "power of the Most High," could not be gazed on by 
Joseph, until she gave birth. But afterwards she is acknowledged by 
Joseph, by looking on her face, not by lustful contact.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Jerome, however, grants that this is to be understood of knowledge by 
intercourse; but he observes that "before" or "until" has a twofold sense 
in Scripture. For sometimes it indicates a fixed time, as Gal. 3:19: The 
law "was set because of transgressions, until the seed should come, to 
whom He made the promise." On the other hand, it sometimes indicates an 
indefinite time, as in Ps. 122:2: "Our eyes are unto the Lord our God, 
until He have mercy on us"; from which it is not to be gathered that our 
eyes are turned from God as soon as His mercy has been obtained. In this 
sense those things are indicated "of which we might doubt if they had not 
been written down: while others are left out to be supplied by our 
understanding. Thus the evangelist says that the Mother of God was not 
known by her husband until she gave birth, that we may be given to 
understand that still less did he know her afterwards" (Adversus Helvid. 
v).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The Scriptures are wont to designate as the first-born, not 
only a child who is followed by others, but also the one that is born 
first. "Otherwise, if a child were not first-born unless followed by 
others, the first-fruits would not be due as long as there was no further 
produce" [*Jerome, Adversus Helvid. x]: which is clearly false, since 
according to the law the first-fruits had to be redeemed within a month 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Num++18:16">Num. 18:16</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Some, as Jerome says on Mt. 12:49,50, "suppose that the 
brethren of the Lord were Joseph's sons by another wife. But we 
understand the brethren of the Lord to be not sons of Joseph, but cousins 
of the Saviour, the sons of Mary, His Mother's sister." For "Scripture 
speaks of brethren in four senses; namely, those who are united by being 
of the same parents, of the same nation, of the same family, by common 
affection." Wherefore the brethren of the Lord are so called, not by 
birth, as being born of the same mother; but by relationship, as being 
blood-relations of His. But Joseph, as Jerome says (Contra Helvid. ix), 
is rather to be believed to have remained a virgin, "since he is not said 
to have had another wife," and "a holy man does not live otherwise than 
chastely."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Mary who is called "the mother of James and Joseph" is not 
to be taken for the Mother of our Lord, who is not wont to be named in 
the Gospels save under this designation of her dignity---"the Mother of 
Jesus." This Mary is to be taken for the wife of Alphaeus, whose son was 
James the less, known as the "brother of the Lord" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++1:19">Gal. 1:19</a>).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Mother of God took a vow of virginity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Mother of God did not take a vow of 
virginity. For it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++7:14">Dt. 7:14</a>): "No one shall be barren among 
you of either sex." But sterility is a consequence of virginity. 
Therefore the keeping of virginity was contrary to the commandment of the 
Old Law. But before Christ was born the old law was still in force. 
Therefore at that time the Blessed Virgin could not lawfully take a vow 
of virginity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:25">1 Cor. 7:25</a>): "Concerning virgins I 
have no commandment of the Lord; but I give counsel." But the perfection 
of the counsels was to take its beginning from Christ, who is the "end of 
the Law," as the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++10:4">Rm. 10:4</a>). It was not therefore becoming 
that the Virgin should take a vow of virginity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the gloss of Jerome says on 1 Tim. 5:12, that "for those 
who are vowed to virginity, it is reprehensible not only to marry, but 
also to desire to be married." But the Mother of Christ committed no sin 
for which she could be reprehended, as stated above (<A Href="TP027.html#TPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="TP027.html#TPQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Since 
therefore she was "espoused," as related by Lk. 1:27 it seems that she 
did not take a vow of virginity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Sanct. Virg. iv): "Mary answered the 
announcing angel: 'How shall this be done, because I know not man?' She 
would not have said this unless she had already vowed her virginity to 
God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As we have stated in the SS, Question [88], Article [6], works of 
perfection are more praiseworthy when performed in fulfilment of a vow. 
Now it is clear that for reasons already given (<A Href="TP028.html#TPQ28ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3) virginity had 
a special place in the Mother of God. It was therefore fitting that her 
virginity should be consecrated to God by vow. Nevertheless because, 
while the Law was in force both men and women were bound to attend to the 
duty of begetting, since the worship of God was spread according to 
carnal origin, until Christ was born of that people; the Mother of God is 
not believed to have taken an absolute vow of virginity, before being 
espoused to Joseph, although she desired to do so, yet yielding her own 
will to God's judgment. Afterwards, however, having taken a husband, 
according as the custom of the time required, together with him she took 
a vow of virginity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Because it seemed to be forbidden by the law not to take 
the necessary steps for leaving a posterity on earth, therefore the 
Mother of God did not vow virginity absolutely, but under the condition 
that it were pleasing to God. When, however, she knew that it was 
acceptable to God, she made the vow absolute, before the angel's 
Annunciation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as the fulness of grace was in Christ  perfectly, yet 
some beginning of the fulness preceded in His Mother; so also the 
observance of the counsels, which is an effect of God's grace, began its 
perfection in Christ, but was begun after a fashion in His Virgin Mother.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[28] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> These words of the Apostle are to be understood of those 
who vow chastity absolutely. Christ's Mother did not do this until she 
was espoused to Joseph. After her espousals, however, by their common 
consent she took a vow of virginity together with her spouse.<br>
