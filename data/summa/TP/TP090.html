<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the parts of Penance: (1) in general. (2) each one 
in particular.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether Penance should be assigned any parts?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that parts should not be assigned to Penance. For 
it is the Divine power that works our salvation most secretly in the 
sacraments. Now the Divine power is one and simple. Therefore Penance, 
being a sacrament, should have no parts assigned to it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Penance is both a virtue and a sacrament. Now no parts 
are assigned to it as a virtue, since virtue is a habit, which is a 
simple quality of the mind. In like manner, it seems that parts should 
not be assigned to Penance as a sacrament, because no parts are assigned 
to Baptism and the other sacraments. Therefore no parts at all should be 
assigned to Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the matter of Penance is sin, as stated above (<A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But no parts are assigned to sin. Neither, therefore, should parts 
be assigned to Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The parts of a thing are those out of which the whole 
is composed. Now the perfection of Penance is composed of several things, 
viz. contrition, confession, and satisfaction. Therefore Penance has 
parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The parts of a thing are those into which the whole is 
divided materially, for the parts of a thing are to the whole, what 
matter is to the form; wherefore the parts are reckoned as a kind of 
material cause, and the whole as a kind of formal cause (Phys. ii). 
Accordingly wherever, on the part of matter, we find a kind of plurality, 
there we shall find a reason for assigning parts. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it has been stated above (<A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3), that, in the sacrament of 
Penance, human actions stand as matter: and so, since several actions are 
requisite for the perfection of Penance, viz., contrition, confession, 
and satisfaction, as we shall show further on (<A Href="TP090.html#TPQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it follows that the 
sacrament of Penance has parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Every sacrament is something simple by reason of the Divine 
power, which operates therein: but the Divine power is so great that it 
can operate both through one and through many, and by reason of these 
many, parts may be assigned to a particular sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Parts are not assigned to penance as a virtue: because the 
human acts of which there are several in penance, are related to the 
habit of virtue, not as its parts, but as its effects. It follows, 
therefore, that parts are assigned to Penance as a sacrament, to which 
the human acts are related as matter: whereas in the other sacraments the 
matter does not consist of human acts, but of some one external thing, 
either simple, as water or oil, or compound, as chrism, and so parts are 
not assigned to the other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sins are the remote matter of Penance, inasmuch, to wit, as 
they are the matter or object of the human acts, which are the proper 
matter of Penance as a sacrament.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether contrition, confession, and satisfaction are fittingly assigned as parts of Penance?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contrition, confession, and satisfaction are 
not fittingly assigned as parts of Penance. For contrition is in the 
heart, and so belongs to interior penance; while confession consists of 
words, and satisfaction in deeds; so that the two latter belong to 
interior penance. Now interior penance is not a sacrament, but only 
exterior penance which is perceptible by the senses. Therefore these 
three parts are not fittingly assigned to the sacrament of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, grace is conferred in the sacraments of the New Law, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,3). But no grace is conferred in satisfaction. 
Therefore satisfaction is not part of a sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruit of a thing is not the same as its part. But 
satisfaction is a fruit of penance, according to Lk. 3:8: "Bring forth . 
. . fruits worthy of penance." Therefore it is not a part of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Penance is ordained against sin. But sin can be 
completed merely in the thought by consent, as stated in the FS, Question [72], 
Article [7]: therefore Penance can also. Therefore confession in word and 
satisfaction in deed should not be reckoned as parts of Penance. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It seems that yet more parts should be assigned to 
Penance. For not only is the body assigned as a part of man, as being the 
matter, but also the soul, which is his form. But the aforesaid three, 
being the acts of the penitent, stand as matter, while the priestly 
absolution stands as form. Therefore the priestly absolution should be 
assigned as a fourth part of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A part is twofold, essential and quantitative. The 
essential parts are naturally the form and the matter, and logically the 
genus and the difference. In this way, each sacrament is divided into 
matter and form as its essential parts. Hence it has been said above 
(<A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>, <A Href="TP060.html#TPQ60ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6) that sacraments consist of things and words. But since 
quantity is on the part of matter, quantitative parts are parts of 
matter: and, in this way, as stated above (<A Href="TP090.html#TPQ90A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), parts are assigned 
specially to the sacrament of Penance, as regards the acts of the 
penitent, which are the matter of this sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it has been said above (<A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>, <A Href="TP085.html#TPQ85A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 3) that an offense is atoned 
otherwise in Penance than in vindictive justice. Because, in vindictive 
justice the atonement is made according to the judge's decision, and not 
according to the discretion of the offender or of the person offended; 
whereas, in Penance, the offense is atoned according to the will of the 
sinner, and the judgment of God against Whom the sin was committed, 
because in the latter case we seek not only the restoration of the 
equality of justice, as in vindictive justice, but also and still more 
the reconciliation of friendship, which is accomplished by the offender 
making atonement according to the will of the person offended. 
Accordingly the first requisite on the part of the penitent is the will 
to atone, and this is done by contrition; the second is that he submit to 
the judgment of the priest standing in God's place, and this is done in 
confession; and the third is that he atone according to the decision of 
God's minister, and this is done in satisfaction: and so contrition, 
confession, and satisfaction are assigned as parts of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Contrition, as to its essence, is in the heart, and belongs 
to interior penance; yet, virtually, it belongs to exterior penance, 
inasmuch as it implies the purpose of confessing and making satisfaction.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Satisfaction confers grace, in so far as it is in man's 
purpose, and it increases grace, according as it is accomplished, just as 
Baptism does in adults, as stated above (<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>; <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>, <A Href="TP069.html#TPQ69A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Satisfaction is a part of Penance as a sacrament, and a 
fruit of penance as a virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> More things are required for good, "which proceeds from a 
cause that is entire," than for evil, "which results from each single 
defect," as Dionysius states (Div. Nom.  iv). And thus, although sin is 
completed in the consent of the heart, yet the perfection of Penance 
requires contrition of the heart, together with confession in word and 
satisfaction in deed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Fifth Objection is clear from what has been said.

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that these three are not integral parts of Penance. 
For, as stated above (<A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), Penance is ordained against sin. But 
sins of thought, word, and deed are the subjective and not integral parts 
of sin, because sin is predicated of each one of them. Therefore in 
Penance also, contrition in thought, confession in word, and satisfaction 
in deed are not integral parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no integral part includes within itself another that is 
condivided with it. But contrition includes both confession and 
satisfaction in the purpose of amendment. Therefore they are not integral 
parts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a whole is composed of its integral parts, taken at the 
same time and equally, just as a line is made up of its parts. But such 
is not the case here. Therefore these are not integral parts of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Integral parts are those by which the perfection of the 
whole is integrated. But the perfection of Penance is integrated by these 
three. Therefore they are integral parts of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have said that these three are subjective parts of 
Penance. But this is impossible, because the entire power of the whole is 
present in each subjective part at the same time and equally, just as the 
entire power of an animal, as such, is assured to each animal species, 
all of which species divide the animal genus at the same time and 
equally: which does not apply to the point in question. Wherefore others 
have said that these are potential parts: yet neither can this be true, 
since the whole is present, as to the entire essence, in each potential 
part, just as the entire essence of the soul is present in each of its 
powers: which does not apply to the case in point. Therefore it follows 
that these three are integral parts of Penance, the nature of which is 
that the whole is not present in each of the parts, either as to its 
entire power, or as to its entire essence, but that it is present to all 
of them together at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Sin forasmuch as it is an evil, can be completed in one 
single point, as stated above (<A Href="TP090.html#TPQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4); and so the sin which is 
completed in thought alone, is a special kind of sin. Another species is 
the sin that is completed in thought and word: and yet a third species is 
the sin that is completed in thought,  word, and deed; and the 
quasi-integral parts of this last sin, are that which is in thought, that 
which is in word, and that which is in deed. Wherefore these three are 
the integral parts of Penance, which is completed in them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One integral part can include the whole, though not as to 
its essence: because the foundation, in a way, contains virtually the 
whole building. In this way contrition includes virtually the whole of 
Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All integral parts have a certain relation of order to one 
another: but some are only related as to position, whether in sequence as 
the parts of an army, or by contact, as the parts of a heap, or by being 
fitted together, as the parts of a house, or by continuation, as the 
parts of a line; while some are related, in addition, as to power, as the 
parts of an animal, the first of which is the heart, the others in a 
certain order being dependent on one another: and thirdly some are 
related in the order of time: as the parts of time and movement. 
Accordingly the parts of Penance are related to one another in the order 
of power and time, since they are actions, but not in the order of 
position, since they do not occupy a place.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that penance is unfittingly divided into penance 
before Baptism, penance for mortal, and penance for venial sins. For 
Penance is the second plank after shipwreck, as stated above (<A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), while Baptism is the first. Therefore that which precedes Baptism 
should not be called a species of penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which can destroy the greater, can destroy the 
lesser. Now mortal sin is greater than venial; and penance which regards 
mortal sins regards also venial sins. Therefore they should not be 
considered as different species of penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as after Baptism man commits venial and mortal 
sins, so does he before Baptism. If therefore penance for venial sins is 
distinct from penance for mortal sins after Baptism, in like manner they 
should be distinguished before Baptism. Therefore penance is not 
fittingly divided into these species.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in De Poenitentia [*Cf. Hom. 30 inter 1] 
that these three are species of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> This is a division of penance as a virtue. Now it must be 
observed that every virtue acts in accordance with the time being, as 
also in keeping with other due circumstances, wherefore the virtue of 
penance has its act at this time, according to the requirements of the 
New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 2/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now it belongs to penance to detest one's past sins, and to purpose, at 
the same time, to change one's life for the better, which is the end, so 
to speak, of penance. And since moral matters take their species from the 
end, as stated in the FS, Question [1], Article [3]; FS, 18, Articles [4],6, it is reasonable 
to distinguish various species of penance, according to the various 
changes intended by the penitent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly there is a threefold change intended by the penitent. The 
first is by regeneration unto a new life, and this belongs to that 
penance which precedes Baptism. The second is by reforming one's past 
life after it has been already destroyed, and this belongs to penance for 
mortal sins committed after Baptism. The third is by changing to a more 
perfect operation of life, and this belongs to penance for venial sins, 
which are remitted through a fervent act of charity, as stated above 
(<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87ATHEP1">Articles [2]</a>,3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The penance which precedes Baptism is not a sacrament, but 
an act of virtue disposing one to that sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The penance which washes away mortal sins, washes away 
venial sins also, but the converse does not hold. Wherefore these two 
species of penance are related to one another as perfect and imperfect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[90] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Before Baptism there are no venial sins without mortal 
sins. And since a venial sin cannot be remitted without mortal sin, as 
stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), before Baptism, penance for mortal sins is 
not distinct from penance for venial sins.<br>
