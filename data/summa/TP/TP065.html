<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that there ought not to be seven sacraments. For the 
sacraments derive their efficacy from the Divine power, and the power of 
Christ's Passion. But the Divine power is one, and Christ's Passion is 
one; since "by one oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are 
sanctified" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Heb++10:14">Heb. 10:14</a>). Therefore there should be but one sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a sacrament is intended as a remedy for the defect 
caused by sin. Now this is twofold, punishment and guilt. Therefore two 
sacraments would be enough.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sacraments belong to the actions of the ecclesiastical 
hierarchy, as Dionysius explains (Eccl. Hier. v). But, as he says, there 
are three actions of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, namely, "to cleanse, 
to enlighten, to perfect." Therefore there should be no more than three 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Contra Faust. xix) that the "sacraments" 
of the New Law are "less numerous" than those of the Old Law. But in the 
Old Law there was no sacrament corresponding to Confirmation and Extreme 
Unction. Therefore these should not be counted among the sacraments of 
the New Law. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, lust is not more grievous than other sins, as we have 
made clear in the FS, Question [74], Article [5]; SS, Question [154], Article [3]. But there is no 
sacrament instituted as a remedy for other sins. Therefore neither should 
matrimony be instituted as a remedy for lust.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> On the other hand, It seems that there should be more than seven 
sacraments. For sacraments are a kind of sacred sign. But in the Church 
there are many sanctifications by sensible signs, such as Holy Water the 
Consecration of Altars, and such like. Therefore there are more than 
seven sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, Hugh of St. Victor (De Sacram. i) says that the 
sacraments of the Old Law were oblations, tithes and sacrifices. But the 
Sacrifice of the Church is one sacrament, called the Eucharist. Therefore 
oblations also and tithes should be called sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, there are three kinds of sin, original, mortal and 
venial. Now Baptism is intended as a remedy against original sin, and 
Penance against mortal sin. Therefore besides the seven sacraments, there 
should be another against venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 1/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>; <A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the 
sacraments of the Church were instituted for a twofold purpose: namely, 
in order to perfect man in things pertaining to the worship of God 
according to the religion of Christian life, and to be a remedy against 
the defects caused by sin. And in either way it is becoming that there 
should be seven sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 2/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; For spiritual life has a certain conformity with the life of the body: 
just as other corporeal things have a certain likeness to things 
spiritual. Now a man attains perfection in the corporeal life in two 
ways: first, in regard to his own person; secondly, in regard to the 
whole community of the society in which he lives, for man is by nature a 
social animal. With regard to himself man is perfected in the life of the 
body, in two ways; first, directly [per se], i.e. by acquiring some vital 
perfection; secondly, indirectly [per accidens], i.e. by the removal of 
hindrances to life, such as ailments, or the like. Now the life of the 
body is perfected "directly," in three ways. First, by generation whereby 
a man begins to be and to live: and corresponding to this in the 
spiritual life there is Baptism, which is a spiritual regeneration, 
according to Titus 3:5: "By the laver of regeneration," etc. Secondly, by 
growth whereby a man is brought to perfect size and strength: and 
corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is Confirmation, in 
which the Holy Ghost is given to strengthen us. Wherefore the disciples 
who were already baptized were bidden thus: "Stay you in the city till 
you be endued with power from on high" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++24:49">Lk. 24:49</a>). Thirdly, by 
nourishment, whereby life and strength are preserved to man; and 
corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is the Eucharist. 
Wherefore it is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++6:54">Jn. 6:54</a>): "Except you eat of the flesh of the Son 
of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you." 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 3/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; And this would be enough for man if he had an impassible life, both 
corporally and spiritually; but since man is liable at times to both 
corporal and spiritual infirmity, i.e. sin, hence man needs a cure from 
his infirmity; which cure is twofold. one is the healing, that restores 
health: and corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is Penance, 
according to Ps. 40:5: "Heal my soul, for I have sinned against Thee." 
The other is the restoration of former vigor by means of suitable diet 
and exercise: and corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is 
Extreme Unction, which removes the remainder of sin, and prepares man for 
final glory. Wherefore it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?James+5:15">James 5:15</a>): "And if he be in sins 
they shall be forgiven him."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 4/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In regard to the whole community, man is perfected in two ways. First, 
by receiving power to rule the community and to exercise public acts: and 
corresponding to this in the spiritual life there is the sacrament of 
order, according to the saying of Heb. 7:27, that priests offer 
sacrifices not for themselves only, but also for the people. Secondly in 
regard to natural propagation. This is accomplished by Matrimony both in 
the corporal and in the spiritual life: since it is not only a sacrament 
but also a function of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 5/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may likewise gather the number of the sacraments from their being 
instituted as a remedy against the defect caused by sin. For Baptism is 
intended as a remedy against the absence of spiritual life; Confirmation, 
against the infirmity of soul found in those of recent birth; the 
Eucharist, against the soul's proneness to sin; Penance, against actual 
sin committed after baptism; Extreme Unction, against the remainders of 
sins---of those sins, namely, which are not sufficiently removed by 
Penance, whether through negligence or through ignorance; order, against 
divisions in the community; Matrimony, as a remedy against concupiscence 
in the individual, and against the decrease in numbers that results from 
death.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 6/6-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, again, gather the number of sacraments from a certain adaptation 
to the virtues and to the defects and penal effects resulting from sin. 
They say that Baptism corresponds to Faith, and is ordained as a remedy 
against original sin; Extreme Unction, to Hope, being ordained against 
venial sin; the Eucharist, to Charity, being ordained against the penal 
effect which is malice. order, to Prudence, being ordained against 
ignorance; Penance to Justice, being ordained against mortal sin; 
Matrimony, to Temperance, being ordained against concupiscence; 
Confirmation, to Fortitude, being ordained against infirmity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The same principal agent uses various instruments unto 
various effects, in accordance with the thing to be done. In the same way 
the Divine power and the Passion of Christ work in us through the various 
sacraments as through various instruments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Guilt and punishment are diversified both  according to 
species, inasmuch as there are various species of guilt and punishment, 
and according to men's various states and habitudes. And in this respect 
it was necessary to have a number of sacraments, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In hierarchical actions we must consider the agents, the 
recipients and the actions. The agents are the ministers of the Church; 
and to these the sacrament of order belongs. The recipients are those who 
approach the sacraments: and these are brought into being by Matrimony. 
The actions are "cleansing," "enlightening," and "perfecting." Mere 
cleansing, however, cannot be a sacrament of the New Law, which confers 
grace: yet it belongs to certain sacramentals, i.e. catechism and 
exorcism. But cleansing coupled with enlightening, according to 
Dionysius, belongs to Baptism; and, for him who falls back into sin, they 
belong secondarily to Penance and Extreme Unction. And perfecting, as 
regards power, which is, as it were, a formal perfection, belongs to 
Confirmation: while, as regards the attainment of the end, it belongs to 
the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the sacrament of Confirmation we receive the fulness of 
the Holy Ghost in order to be strengthened; while in Extreme Unction man 
is prepared for the immediate attainment of glory; and neither of these 
two purposes was becoming to the Old Testament. Consequently, nothing in 
the old Law could correspond to these sacraments. Nevertheless, the 
sacraments of the old Law were more numerous, on account of the various 
kinds of sacrifices and ceremonies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> There was need for a special sacrament to be applied as a 
remedy against venereal concupiscence: first because by this 
concupiscence, not only the person but also the nature is defiled: 
secondly, by reason of its vehemence whereby it clouds the reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Holy Water and other consecrated things are not called 
sacraments, because they do not produce the sacramental effect, which is 
the receiving of grace. They are, however, a kind of disposition to the 
sacraments: either by removing obstacles. thus holy water is ordained 
against the snares of the demons, and against venial sins: or by making 
things suitable for the conferring of a sacrament; thus the altar and 
vessels are consecrated through reverence for the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> Oblations and tithes, both the Law of nature and in the Law 
of Moses, ere ordained not only for the sustenance of the ministers and 
the poor, but also figuratively; and consequently they were sacraments. 
But now they remain no longer as figures, and therefore they are not 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> The infusion of grace is not necessary for the blotting out 
of venial sin. Wherefore, since grace is infused in each of the 
sacraments of the New Law, none of them was instituted directly against 
venial sin. This is taken away by certain  sacramentals, for instance, 
Holy Water and such like. Some, however, hold that Extreme Unction is 
ordained against venial sin. But of this we shall speak in its proper 
place (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP030.html#XPQ30OUTP1">Question [30]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP030.html#XPQ30A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the order of the sacraments as given above is 
unbecoming. For according to the Apostle (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++15:46">1 Cor. 15:46</a>), "that was . . . 
first . . . which is natural, afterwards that which is spiritual." But 
man is begotten through Matrimony by a first and natural generation; 
while in Baptism he is regenerated as by a second and spiritual 
generation. Therefore Matrimony should precede Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, through the sacrament of order man receives the power of 
agent in sacramental actions. But the agent precedes his action. 
Therefore order should precede Baptism and the other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Eucharist is a spiritual food; while Confirmation is 
compared to growth. But food causes, and consequently precedes, growth. 
Therefore the Eucharist precedes Confirmation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Penance prepares man for the Eucharist. But a 
disposition precedes perfection. Therefore Penance should precede the 
Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, that which is nearer the last end comes after other 
things. But, of all the sacraments, Extreme Unction is nearest to the 
last end which is Happiness. Therefore it should be placed last among the 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The order of the sacraments, as given above, is 
commonly adopted by all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The reason of the order among the sacraments appears from 
what has been said above (<A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For just as unity precedes multitude, so 
those sacraments which are intended for the perfection of the individual, 
naturally precede those which are intended for the perfection of the 
multitude; and consequently the last place among the sacraments is given 
to order and Matrimony, which are intended for the perfection of the 
multitude: while Matrimony is placed after order, because it has less 
participation in the nature of the spiritual life, to which the 
sacraments are ordained. Moreover, among things ordained to the 
perfection of the individual, those naturally come first which are 
ordained directly to the perfection of the spiritual life, and 
afterwards, those which are ordained thereto indirectly, viz. by removing 
some supervening accidental cause of harm; such are Penance and Extreme 
Unction: while, of these, Extreme Unction is naturally placed last, for 
it preserves the healing which was begun by Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] Body Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the remaining three, it is clear that Baptism which is a spiritual 
regeneration, comes first; then Confirmation, which is ordained to the 
formal perfection of power; and after these the Eucharist which is 
ordained to final perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Matrimony as ordained to natural life is a function of 
nature. But in so far as it has something spiritual it is a sacrament. 
And because it has the least amount of spirituality it is placed last.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> For a thing to be an agent it must first of all be perfect 
in itself. Wherefore those sacraments by which a man is perfected in 
himself, are placed before the sacrament of order, in which a man is made 
a perfecter of others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Nourishment both precedes growth, as its cause; and follows 
it, as maintaining the perfection of size and power in man. Consequently, 
the Eucharist can be placed before Confirmation, as Dionysius places it 
(Eccl. Hier. iii, iv), and can be placed after it, as the Master does 
(iv, 2,8).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument would hold if Penance were required of 
necessity as a preparation to the Eucharist. But this is not true: for if 
anyone be without mortal sin, he does not need Penance in order to 
receive the Eucharist. Thus it is clear that Penance is an accidental 
preparation to the Eucharist, that is to say, sin being supposed. 
Wherefore it is written in the last chapter of the second Book of 
Paralipomenon (cf. 2 Paral 33:18): "Thou, O Lord of the righteous, didst 
not impose penance on righteous men." [*The words quoted are from the 
apocryphal Prayer of Manasses, which, before the Council of Trent, was to 
be found inserted in some Latin copies of the Bible.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Extreme Unction, for this very reason, is given the last 
place among those sacraments which are ordained to the perfection of the 
individual.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Eucharist is the greatest of the sacraments?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the Eucharist is not the principal of the 
sacraments. For the common good is of more account than the good of the 
individual (1 Ethic. ii). But Matrimony is ordained to the common good of 
the human race by means of generation: whereas the sacrament of the 
Eucharist is ordained to the private good of the recipient. Therefore it 
is not the greatest of the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those sacraments, seemingly, are greater, which are 
conferred by a greater minister. But the sacraments of Confirmation and 
order are conferred by a bishop only, who is a greater minister than a 
mere minister such as a priest, by whom the sacraments of the Eucharist 
is conferred. Therefore those sacraments are greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those sacraments are greater that have the greater 
power. But some of the sacraments imprint a character, viz. Baptism, 
Confirmation and order; whereas the Eucharist does not. Therefore those 
sacraments are greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that seems to be greater, on which others depend without 
its depending on them. But the Eucharist depends on Baptism: since no one 
can receive the Eucharist except he has been baptized. Therefore Baptism 
is greater than the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii) that "No one receives 
hierarchical perfection save by the most God-like Eucharist." Therefore 
this sacrament is greater than all the others and perfects them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Absolutely speaking, the sacrament of the Eucharist is 
the greatest of all the sacraments: and this may be shown in three ways. 
First of all because it contains Christ Himself substantially: whereas 
the other sacraments contain a certain instrumental power which is a 
share of Christ's power, as we have shown above (<A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3, <A Href="TP062.html#TPQ62A4A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Now that which is essentially such is always of more account than that 
which is such by participation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, this is made clear by considering the relation of the 
sacraments to one another. For all the other sacraments seem to be 
ordained to this one as to their end. For it is manifest that the 
sacrament of order is ordained to the consecration of the Eucharist: and 
the sacrament of Baptism to the reception of the Eucharist: while a man 
is perfected by Confirmation, so as not to fear to abstain from this 
sacrament. By Penance and Extreme Unction man is prepared to receive the 
Body of Christ worthily. And Matrimony at least in its signification, 
touches this sacrament; in so far as it signifies the union of Christ 
with the Church, of which union the Eucharist is a figure: hence the 
Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++5:32">Eph. 5:32</a>): "This is a great sacrament: but I speak in 
Christ and in the Church."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thirdly, this is made clear by considering the rites of the sacraments. 
For nearly all the sacraments terminate in the Eucharist, as Dionysius 
says (Eccl. Hier. iii): thus those who have been ordained receive Holy 
Communion, as also do those who have been baptized, if they be adults.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The remaining sacraments may be compared to one another in several ways. 
For on the ground of necessity, Baptism is the greatest of the 
sacraments; while from the point of view of perfection, order comes 
first; while Confirmation holds a middle place. The sacraments of Penance 
and Extreme Unction are on a degree inferior to those mentioned above; 
because, as stated above (<A Href="TP065.html#TPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), they are ordained to the Christian life, 
not directly, but accidentally, as it were, that is to say, as remedies 
against supervening defects. And among these, Extreme Unction is compared 
to Penance, as Confirmation to Baptism; in such a way, that Penance  is 
more necessary, whereas Extreme Unction is more perfect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Matrimony is ordained to the common good as regards the 
body. But the common spiritual good of the whole Church is contained 
substantially in the sacrament itself of the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By order and Confirmation the faithful of Christ are 
deputed to certain special duties; and this can be done by the prince 
alone. Consequently the conferring of these sacraments belongs 
exclusively to a bishop, who is, as it were, a prince in the Church. But 
a man is not deputed to any duty by the sacrament of the Eucharist, 
rather is this sacrament the end of all duties, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sacramental character, as stated above (<A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>, <A Href="TP063.html#TPQ63A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), 
is a kind of participation in Christ's priesthood. Wherefore the 
sacrament that unites man to Christ Himself, is greater than a sacrament 
that imprints Christ's character.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This argument proceeds on the ground of necessity. For thus 
Baptism, being of the greatest necessity, is the greatest of the 
sacraments, just as order and Confirmation have a certain excellence 
considered in their administration; and Matrimony by reason of its 
signification. For there is no reason why a thing should not be greater 
from a certain point of view which is not greater absolutely speaking.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether all the sacraments are necessary for salvation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that all the sacraments are necessary for salvation. For 
what is not necessary seems to be superfluous. But no sacrament is 
superfluous, because "God does nothing without a purpose" (De Coelo et 
Mundo i). Therefore all the sacraments are necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as it is said of Baptism (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++3:5">Jn. 3:5</a>): "Unless a man 
be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot enter in to the 
kingdom of God," so of the Eucharist is it said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++6:54">Jn. 6:54</a>): "Except you 
eat of the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink of His blood, you shall not 
have life in you." Therefore, just as Baptism is a necessary sacrament, 
so is the Eucharist.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man can be saved without the sacrament of Baptism, 
provided that some unavoidable obstacle, and not his contempt for 
religion, debar him from the sacrament, as we shall state further on 
(<A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="TP068.html#TPQ68A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). But contempt of religion in any sacrament is a hindrance 
to salvation. Therefore, in like manner, all the sacraments are necessary 
for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Children are saved by Baptism alone without the other 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 1/3 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Necessity of end, of which we speak now, is twofold. 
First, a thing may be necessary so that without it the end cannot be 
attained; thus food is necessary for human life. And this is simple 
necessity of end. Secondly, a thing is said to be necessary, if, without 
it, the end cannot be attained so becomingly: thus a horse is necessary 
for a journey. But this is not simple necessity of end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the first way, three sacraments are necessary for salvation. Two of 
them are necessary to the individual; Baptism, simply and absolutely; 
Penance, in the case of mortal sin committed after Baptism; while the 
sacrament of order is necessary to the Church, since "where there is no 
governor the people shall fall" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++11:14">Prov. 11:14</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But in the second way the other sacraments are necessary. For in a sense 
Confirmation perfects Baptism; Extreme Unction perfects Penance; while 
Matrimony, by multiplying them, preserves the numbers in the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> For a thing not to be superfluous it is enough if it be 
necessary either in the first or the second way. It is thus that the 
sacraments are necessary, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These words of our Lord are to be understood of spiritual, 
and not of merely sacramental, eating, as Augustine explains (Tract. xxvi 
super Joan.).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although contempt of any of the sacraments is a hindrance 
to salvation, yet it does not amount to contempt of the sacrament, if 
anyone does not trouble to receive a sacrament that is not necessary for 
salvation. Else those who do not receive orders, and those who do not 
contract Matrimony, would be guilty of contempt of those sacraments.<br>
