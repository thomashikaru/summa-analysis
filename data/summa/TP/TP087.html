<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin can be forgiven without penance. 
For, as stated above (<A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="TP084.html#TPQ84A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>, ad 4), it is essential to  true 
penance that man should not only sorrow for his past sins, but also that 
he should purpose to avoid them for the future. Now venial sins are 
forgiven without any such purpose, for it is certain that man cannot lead 
the present life without committing venial sins. Therefore venial sins 
can be forgiven without penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is no penance without actual displeasure at one's 
sins. But venial sins can be taken away without any actual displeasure at 
them, as would be the case if a man were to be killed in his sleep, for 
Christ's sake, since he would go to heaven at once, which would not 
happen if his venial sins remained. Therefore venial sins can be forgiven 
without penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, venial sins are contrary to the fervor of charity, as 
stated in the SS, Question [24], Article [10]. Now one contrary is removed by another. 
Therefore forgiveness of venial sins is caused by the fervor of charity, 
which may be without actual displeasure at venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in De Poenitentia [*De vera et falsa 
Poenitentia, the authorship of which is unknown], that "there is a 
penance which is done for venial sins in the Church every day" which 
would be useless if venial sins could be forgiven without Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Forgiveness of sin, as stated above (<A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>, <A Href="TP086.html#TPQ86A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), is 
effected by man being united to God from Whom sin separates him in some 
way. Now this separation is made complete by mortal sin, and incomplete 
by venial sin: because, by mortal sin, the mind through acting against 
charity is altogether turned away from God; whereas by venial sin man's 
affections are clogged, so that they are slow in tending towards God. 
Consequently both kinds of sin are taken away by penance, because by both 
of them man's will is disordered through turning inordinately to a 
created good; for just as mortal sin cannot be forgiven so long as the 
will is attached to sin, so neither can venial sin, because while the 
cause remains, the effect remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet a more perfect penance is requisite for the forgiveness of mortal 
sin, namely that man should detest actually the mortal sin which he 
committed, so far as lies in his power, that is to say, he should 
endeavor to remember each single mortal sin, in order to detest each one. 
But this is, not required for the forgiveness of venial sins; although it 
does not suffice to have habitual displeasure, which is included in the 
habit of charity or of penance as a virtue, since then venial sin would 
be incompatible with charity, which is evidently untrue. Consequently it 
is necessary to have a certain virtual displeasure, so that, for 
instance, a man's affections so tend to God and Divine things, that 
whatever might happen to him to hamper that tendency would be displeasing 
to him, and would grieve him, were he to commit it, even though he were 
not to think of it actually: and this is not sufficient for the remission 
of mortal sin, except as regards those sins which he fails to remember 
after a careful examination. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When man is in a state of grace, he can avoid all mortal 
sins, and each single one; and he can avoid each single venial sin, but 
not all, as was explained in the FS, Question [74], Article [8], ad 2; FS, Question [109], Article [8]. 
Consequently penance for mortal sins requires man to purpose abstaining 
from mortal sins, all and each; whereas penance for venial sins requires 
man to purpose abstaining from each, but not from all, because the 
weakness of this life does not allow of this. Nevertheless he needs to 
have the purpose of taking steps to commit fewer venial sins, else he 
would be in danger of falling back, if he gave up the desire of going 
forward, or of removing the obstacles to spiritual progress, such as 
venial sins are.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Death for Christ's sake, as stated above (<A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1">Question [66]</a>, <A Href="TP066.html#TPQ66A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>), 
obtains the power of Baptism, wherefore it washes away all sin, both 
venial and mortal, unless it find the will attached to sin.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The fervor of charity implies virtual displeasure at venial

<H3 Align="Left">Whether infusion of grace is necessary for the remission of venial sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that infusion of grace is necessary for the 
remission of venial sins. Because an effect is not produced without its 
proper cause. Now the proper cause of the remission of sins is grace; for 
man's sins are not forgiven through his own merits; wherefore it is 
written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Eph++2:4,5">Eph. 2:4,5</a>): "God, Who is rich in mercy, for His exceeding 
charity, wherewith He loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath 
quickened us together in Christ, by Whose grace you are saved." Therefore 
venial sins are not forgiven without infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, venial sins are not forgiven without Penance. Now grace 
is infused, in Penance as in the other sacraments of the New Law. 
Therefore venial sins are not forgiven without infusion of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, venial sin produces a stain on the soul. Now a stain is 
not removed save by grace which is the spiritual beauty of the soul. 
Therefore it seems that venial sins are not forgiven without infusion of 
grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The advent of venial sin neither destroys nor 
diminishes grace, as stated in the SS, Question [24], Article [10]. Therefore, in like 
manner, an infusion of grace is not necessary in order to remove venial 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Each thing is removed by its contrary. But venial sin is 
not contrary to habitual grace or charity, but hampers its act, through 
man being too much attached to a created good, albeit not in opposition 
to God, as stated in the FS, Question [88],  Article [1]; SS, Question [24], Article [10]. Therefore, 
in order that venial sin be removed, it is not necessary that habitual 
grace be infused, but a movement of grace or charity suffices for its 
forgiveness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, since in those who have the use of free-will (in whom 
alone can there be venial sins), there can be no infusion of grace 
without an actual movement of the free-will towards God and against sin, 
consequently whenever grace is infused anew, venial sins are forgiven.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Even the forgiveness of venial sins is an effect of grace, 
in virtue of the act which grace produces anew, but not through any habit 
infused anew into the soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Venial sin is never forgiven without some act, explicit or 
implicit, of the virtue of penance, as stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): it can, 
however, be forgiven without the sacrament of Penance, which is formally 
perfected by the priestly absolution, as stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Hence it does not follow that infusion of grace is required for the 
forgiveness of venial sin, for although this infusion takes place in 
every sacrament, it does not occur in every act of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as there are two kinds of bodily stain, one consisting 
in the privation of something required for beauty, e.g. the right color 
or the due proportion of members, and another by the introduction of some 
hindrance to beauty, e.g. mud or dust; so too, a stain is put on the 
soul, in one way, by the privation of the beauty of grace through mortal 
sin, in another, by the inordinate inclination of the affections to some 
temporal thing, and this is the result of venial sin. Consequently, an 
infusion of grace is necessary for the removal of mortal sin, but in 
order to remove venial sin, it is necessary to have a movement proceeding 
from grace, removing the inordinate attachment to the temporal thing.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether venial sins are removed by the sprinkling of holy water and the like?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sins are not removed by the sprinkling 
of holy water, a bishop's blessing, and the like. For venial sins are not 
forgiven without Penance, as stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But Penance suffices by 
itself for the remission of venial sins. Therefore the above have nothing 
to do with the remission of venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, each of the above bears the same relation to one venial 
sin as to all. If therefore, by means of one of them, some venial sin is 
remitted, it follows that in like manner all are remitted, so that by 
beating his breast once, or by being sprinkled once with holy water, a 
man would be delivered from all his venial sins, which seems unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, venial sins occasion a debt of some punishment, albeit 
temporal; for it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++3:12,15">1 Cor. 3:12,15</a>) of him that builds up "wood, 
hay, stubble" that "he shall be saved, yet so as by fire." Now the above 
things whereby venial sins are said to be taken away, contain either no 
punishment at all, or very little. Therefore they do not suffice for the 
full remission of venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in De Poenitentia [*Hom. 30 inter 1; Ep. 
cclxv] that "for our slight sins we strike our breasts, and say: Forgive 
us our trespasses," and so it seems that striking one's breast, and the 
Lord's Prayer cause the remission of venial sins: and the same seems to 
apply to the other things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), no infusion of fresh grace is 
required for the forgiveness of a venial sin, but it is enough to have an 
act proceeding from grace, in detestation of that venial sin, either 
explicit or at least implicit, as when one is moved fervently to God. 
Hence, for three reasons, certain things cause the remission of venial 
sins: first, because they imply the infusion of grace, since the infusion 
of grace removes venial sins, as stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>); and so, by the 
Eucharist, Extreme Unction, and by all the sacraments of the New Law 
without exception, wherein grace is conferred, venial sins are remitted. 
Secondly, because they imply a movement of detestation for sin, and in 
this way the general confession [*i.e. the recital of the Confiteor or of 
an act of contrition], the beating of one's breast, and the Lord's Prayer 
conduce to the remission of venial sins, for we ask in the Lord's Prayer: 
"Forgive us our trespasses." Thirdly, because they include a movement of 
reverence for God and Divine things; and in this way a bishop's blessing, 
the sprinkling of holy water, any sacramental anointing, a prayer said in 
a dedicated church, and anything else of the kind, conduce to the 
remission of venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> All these things cause the remission of venial sins, in so 
far as they incline the soul to the movement of penance, viz., the 
implicit or explicit detestation of one's sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All these things, so far as they are concerned, conduce to 
the remission of all venial sins: but the remission may be hindered as 
regards certain venial sins, to which the mind is still actually 
attached, even as insincerity sometimes impedes the effect of Baptism.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By the above things, venial sins are indeed taken away as 
regards the guilt, both because those things are a kind of satisfaction, 
and through the virtue of charity whose movement is aroused by such 
things.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet it does not always happen that, by means of each one, the whole 
guilt of punishment is taken away, because, in that case, whoever was 
entirely free from mortal sin, would go straight to heaven if sprinkled 
with holy water: but the debt of punishment is remitted by means of the 
above, according to the movement of fervor  towards God, which fervor is 
aroused by such things, sometimes more, sometimes less.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin can be taken away without mortal 
sin. For, on Jn. 8:7: "He that is without sin among you, let him first 
cast a stone at her," a gloss says that "all those men were in a state of 
mortal sin: for venial offenses were forgiven them through the legal 
ceremonies." Therefore venial sin can be taken away without mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no infusion of grace is required for the remission of 
venial sin. but it is required for the forgiveness of mortal sin. 
Therefore venial sin can be taken away without mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a venial sin differs from a mortal sin more than from 
another venial sin. But one venial sin can be pardoned without another, 
as stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore a venial sin can be 
taken away without a mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++5:26">Mt. 5:26</a>): "Amen I say to thee, thou 
shalt not go out from thence," viz., from the prison, into which a man is 
cast for mortal sin, "till thou repay the last farthing," by which venial 
sin is denoted. Therefore a venial sin is not forgiven without mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87OUTP1">Question [87]</a>, <A Href="TP087.html#TPQ87A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), there is no remission of 
any sin whatever except by the power of grace, because, as the Apostle 
declares (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++4:8">Rm. 4:8</a>), it is owing to God's grace that He does not impute 
sin to a man, which a gloss on that passage expounds as referring to 
venial sin. Now he that is in a state of mortal sin is without the grace 
of God. Therefore no venial sin is forgiven him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Venial offenses, in the passage quoted, denote the 
irregularities or uncleannesses which men contracted in accordance with 
the Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although no new infusion of habitual grace is requisite for 
the remission of venial sin, yet it is necessary to exercise some act of 
grace, which cannot be in one who is a subject of mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[87] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Venial sin does not preclude every act of grace whereby all 
venial sins can be removed; whereas mortal sin excludes altogether the 
habit of grace, without which no sin, either mortal or venial, is 
remitted. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
