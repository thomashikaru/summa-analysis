PROLOGUE<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Forasmuch as our Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ, in order to "save His 
people from their sins" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++1:21">Mt. 1:21</a>), as the angel announced, showed unto 
us in His own Person the way of truth, whereby we may attain to the bliss 
of eternal life by rising again, it is necessary, in order to complete 
the work of theology, that after considering the last end of human life, 
and the virtues and vices, there should follow the consideration of the 
Saviour of all, and of the benefits bestowed by Him on the human race.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Prologue Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning this we must consider (1) the Saviour Himself; (2) the 
sacraments by which we attain to our salvation; (3) the end of immortal 
life to which we attain by the resurrection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Prologue Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Concerning the first, a double consideration occurs: the first, about 
the mystery of the Incarnation itself, whereby God was made man for our 
salvation; the second, about such things as were done and suffered by our 
Saviour---i.e. God incarnate.<br>
