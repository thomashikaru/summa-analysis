<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the assumption of the parts of human nature; and 
under this head there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ5A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the Son of God ought to have assumed a true body?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="#TPQ5A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He ought to have assumed an earthly body, i.e. one of flesh 
and blood?<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a true body. For 
it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++2:7">Phil. 2:7</a>), that He was "made in the likeness of men." But 
what is something in truth is not said to be in the likeness thereof. 
Therefore the Son of God did not assume a true body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the assumption of a body in no way diminishes the 
dignity of the Godhead; for Pope Leo says (Serm. de Nativ.) that "the 
glorification did not absorb the lesser nature, nor did the assumption 
lessen the higher." But it pertains to the dignity of God to be 
altogether separated from bodies. Therefore it seems that by the 
assumption God was not united to a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, signs ought to correspond to the realities. But the 
apparitions of the Old Testament which were signs of the manifestation of 
Christ were not in a real body, but by visions in the imagination, as is 
plain from Is. 60:1: "I saw the Lord sitting," etc. Hence it would seem 
that the apparition of the Son of God in the world was not in a real 
body, but only in imagination.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 13): "If the body of 
Christ was a phantom, Christ deceived us, and if He deceived us, He is 
not the Truth. But Christ is the Truth. Therefore His body was not a 
phantom." Hence it is plain that He assumed a true body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As is said (De Eccles. Dogm. ii). The Son of God was not 
born in appearance only, as if He had an imaginary body; but His body was 
real. The proof of this is threefold. First, from the essence of human 
nature to which it pertains to have a true body. Therefore granted, as 
already proved (<A Href="TP004.html#TPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="TP004.html#TPQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that it was fitting for the Son of God to 
assume human nature, He must consequently have assumed a real body. The 
second reason is taken from what was done in the mystery of the 
Incarnation. For if His body was not real but imaginary, He neither 
underwent a real death, nor of those things which the Evangelists recount 
of Him, did He do any in very truth, but only in appearance; and hence it 
would also follow that the real salvation of man has not taken place; 
since the effect must be proportionate to the cause. The third reason is 
taken from the dignity of the Person assuming, Whom it did not become to 
have anything fictitious in His work, since He is the Truth. Hence our 
Lord Himself deigned to refute this error (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk+++24:37,39">Lk.  24:37,39</a>), when the 
disciples, "troubled and frighted, supposed that they saw a spirit," and 
not a true body; wherefore He offered Himself to their touch, saying: 
"Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to 
have."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This likeness indicates the truth of the human nature in 
Christ---just as all that truly exist in human nature are said to be like 
in species---and not a mere imaginary likeness. In proof of this the 
Apostle subjoins (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Phil++2:8">Phil. 2:8</a>) that He became "obedient unto death, even to 
the death of the cross"; which would have been impossible, had it been 
only an imaginary likeness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> By assuming a true body the dignity of the Son of God is 
nowise lessened. Hence Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum 
ii): "He emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, that He might 
become a servant; yet did He not lose the fulness of the form of God." 
For the Son of God assumed a true body, not so as to become the form of a 
body, which is repugnant to the Divine simplicity and purity---for this 
would be to assume a body to the unity of the nature, which is 
impossible, as is plain from what has been stated above (<A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="TP002.html#TPQ2A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>): 
but, the natures remaining distinct, He assumed a body to the unity of 
Person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The figure ought to correspond to the reality as regards 
the likeness and not as regards the truth of the thing. For if they were 
alike in all points, it would no longer be a likeness but the reality 
itself, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 26). Hence it was more 
fitting that the apparitions of the old Testament should be in appearance 
only, being figures; and that the apparition of the Son of God in the 
world should be in a real body, being the thing prefigured by these 
figures. Hence the Apostle says (Col. 2:17): "Which are a shadow of 
things to come, but the body is Christ's."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ had not a carnal or earthly, but a 
heavenly body. For the Apostle says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++15:41">1 Cor. 15:41</a>): "The first man was of 
the earth, earthy; the second man from heaven, heavenly." But the first 
man, i.e. Adam, was of the earth as regards his body, as is plain from 
Gn. 1. Therefore the second man, i.e. Christ, was of heaven as regards 
the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is said (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++15:50">1 Cor. 15:50</a>): "Flesh and blood shall not 
[Vulg.: 'cannot'] possess the kingdom of God." But the kingdom of God is 
in Christ chiefly. Therefore there is no flesh or blood in Him, but 
rather a heavenly body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whatever is best is to be attributed to God. But of all 
bodies a heavenly body is the best. Therefore it behooved Christ to 
assume such a body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our Lord says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++24:39">Lk. 24:39</a>): "A spirit hath not flesh and 
bones, as you see Me to have." Now flesh and bones are not of the matter 
of heavenly bodies, but are composed of the inferior elements. Therefore 
the body of Christ was not a heavenly, but a carnal and earthly body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By the reasons which proved that the body of Christ was 
not an imaginary one, it may also be shown that it was not a heavenly 
body. First, because even as the truth of the human nature of Christ 
would not have been maintained had His body been an imaginary one, such 
as Manes supposed, so likewise it would not have been maintained if we 
supposed, as did Valentine, that it was a heavenly body. For since the 
form of man is a natural thing, it requires determinate matter, to wit, 
flesh and bones, which must be placed in the definition of man, as is 
plain from the Philosopher (Metaph. vii, 39). Secondly, because this 
would lessen the truth of such things as Christ did in the body. For 
since a heavenly body is impassible and incorruptible, as is proved De 
Coel. i, 20, if the Son of God had assumed a heavenly body, He would not 
have truly hungered or thirsted, nor would he have undergone His passion 
and death. Thirdly, this would have detracted from God's truthfulness. 
For since the Son of God showed Himself to men, as if He had a carnal and 
earthly body, the manifestation would have been false, had He had a 
heavenly body. Hence (De Eccles. Dogm. ii) it is said: "The Son of God 
was born, taking flesh of the Virgin's body, and not bringing it with Him 
from heaven."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ is said in two ways to have come down from heaven. 
First, as regards His Divine Nature; not indeed that the Divine Nature 
ceased to be in heaven, but inasmuch as He began to be here below in a 
new way, viz. by His assumed. nature, according to Jn. 3:13: "No man hath 
ascended into heaven, but He that descended from heaven, the Son of Man, 
Who is in heaven."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, as regards His body, not indeed that the very substance of the 
body of Christ descended from heaven, but that His body was formed by a 
heavenly power, i.e. by the Holy Ghost. Hence Augustine, explaining the 
passage quoted, says (Ad Orosium [*Dial. Qq. lxv, qu. 4, work of an 
unknown author]): "I call Christ a heavenly man because He was not 
conceived of human seed." And Hilary expounds it in the same way (De 
Trin. x).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Flesh and blood are not taken here for the substance of 
flesh and blood, but for the corruption of flesh, which was not in Christ 
as far as it was sinful; but as far as it was a punishment; thus, for a 
time, it was in Christ, that He might carry through the work of our 
redemption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It pertains to the greatest glory of God to have raised a 
weak and earthly body to such sublimity. Hence in the General Council of 
Ephesus (P. II, Act. I) we read the saying of St. Theophilus: "Just as 
the best workmen are esteemed not merely for displaying their skill in 
precious materials, but very often because by making use of the poorest . 
. . lay and commonest earth,  they show the power of their craft; so the 
best of all workmen, the Word of God, did not come down to us by taking a 
heavenly body of some most precious matter, but shewed the greatness of 
His skill in clay."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Son of God assumed a soul?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a soul. For John 
has said, teaching the mystery of the Incarnation (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++1:14">Jn. 1:14</a>): "The Word 
was made flesh"---no mention being made of a soul. Now it is not said 
that "the Word was made flesh" as if changed to flesh, but because He 
assumed flesh. Therefore He seems not to have assumed a soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a soul is necessary to the body, in order to quicken it. 
But this was not necessary for the body of Christ, as it would seem, for 
of the Word of God it is written (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Ps++35:10">Ps. 35:10</a>): Lord, "with Thee is the 
fountain of life." Therefore it would seem altogether superfluous for the 
soul to be there, when the Word was present. But "God and nature do 
nothing uselessly," as the Philosopher says (De Coel. i, 32; ii, 56). 
Therefore the Word would seem not to have assumed a soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by the union of soul and body is constituted the common 
nature, which is the human species. But "in the Lord Jesus Christ we are 
not to look for a common species," as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 
3). Therefore He did not assume a soul.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Agone Christ. xxi): "Let us not 
hearken to such as say that only a human body was assumed by the Word of 
God; and take 'the Word was made flesh' to mean that the man had no soul 
nor any other part of a man, save flesh."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Haeres. 69,55), it was first of all 
the opinion of Arius and then of Apollinaris that the Son of God assumed 
only flesh, without a soul, holding that the Word took the place of a 
soul to the body. And consequently it followed that there were not two 
natures in Christ, but only one; for from a soul and body one human 
nature is constituted. But this opinion cannot hold, for three reasons. 
First, because it is counter to the authority of Scripture, in which our 
Lord makes mention of His soul, Mt. 26:38: "My soul is sorrowful even 
unto death"; and Jn. 10:18: "I have power to lay down My soul [animam 
meam: Douay: 'My life']." But to this Apollinaris replied that in these 
words soul is taken metaphorically, in which way mention is made in the 
Old Testament of the soul of God (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++1:14">Is. 1:14</a>): "My soul hateth your new 
moons and your solemnities." But, as Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 
80), the Evangelists relate how Jesus wondered, was angered, sad, and 
hungry. Now these show that He had a true soul, just as that He ate, 
slept and was weary shows that He had a true human body: otherwise, if 
these things are a metaphor, because the like are said of God in the Old 
Testament, the trustworthiness of the Gospel story is undermined. For it 
is one thing that things  were foretold in a figure, and another that 
historical events were related in very truth by the Evangelists. 
Secondly, this error lessens the utility of the Incarnation, which is 
man's liberation. For Augustine [*Vigilius Tapsensis] argues thus (Contra 
Felician. xiii): "If the Son of God in taking flesh passed over the soul, 
either He knew its sinlessness, and trusted it did not need a remedy; or 
He considered it unsuitable to Him, and did not bestow on it the boon of 
redemption; or He reckoned it altogether incurable, and was unable to 
heal it; or He cast it off as worthless and seemingly unfit for any use. 
Now two of these reasons imply a blasphemy against God. For how shall we 
call Him omnipotent, if He is unable to heal what is beyond hope? Or God 
of all, if He has not made our soul. And as regards the other two 
reasons, in one the cause of the soul is ignored, and in the other no 
place is given to merit. Is He to be considered to understand the cause 
of the soul, Who seeks to separate it from the sin of wilful 
transgression, enabled as it is to receive the law by the endowment of 
the habit of reason? Or how can His generosity be known to any one who 
says it was despised on account of its ignoble sinfulness? If you look at 
its origin, the substance of the soul is more precious than the body: but 
if at the sin of transgression, on account of its intelligence it is 
worse than the body. Now I know and declare that Christ is perfect 
wisdom, nor have I any doubt that He is most loving; and because of the 
first of these He did not despise what was better and more capable of 
prudence; and because of the second He protected what was most wounded." 
Thirdly, this position is against the truth of the Incarnation. For flesh 
and the other parts of man receive their species through the soul. Hence, 
if the soul is absent, there are no bones nor flesh, except equivocally, 
as is plain from the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 9; Metaph. vii, 34).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When we say, "The Word was made flesh," "flesh" is taken 
for the whole man, as if we were to say, "The Word was made man," as Is. 
40:5: "All flesh together shall see that the mouth of the Lord hath 
spoken." And the whole man is signified by flesh, because, as is said in 
the authority quoted, the Son of God became visible by flesh; hence it is 
subjoined: "And we saw His glory." Or because, as Augustine says (Qq. 
lxxxiii, qu. 80), "in all that union the Word is the highest, and flesh 
the last and lowest. Hence, wishing to commend the love of God's humility 
to us, the Evangelist mentioned the Word and flesh, leaving the soul on 
one side, since it is less than the Word and nobler than flesh." Again, 
it was reasonable to mention flesh, which, as being farther away from the 
Word, was less assumable, as it would seem.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The Word is the fountain of life, as the first effective 
cause of life; but the soul is the principle of the life of the body, as 
its form. Now the form is the effect of the agent. Hence from the 
presence of the Word it might rather have been concluded that the body 
was animated, just as from the presence of fire it may be concluded that 
the body, in which fire adheres, is warm.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not unfitting, indeed it is necessary to say that in 
Christ there was a nature which was constituted by the soul coming to the 
body. But Damascene denied that in Jesus Christ there was a common 
species, i.e. a third something resulting from the Godhead and the 
humanity.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Son of God did not assume a human mind or 
intellect. For where a thing is present, its image is not required. But 
man is made to God's image, as regards his mind, as Augustine says (De 
Trin. xiv, 3,6). Hence, since in Christ there was the presence of the 
Divine Word itself, there was no need of a human mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the greater light dims the lesser. But the Word of God, 
Who is "the light, which enlighteneth every man that cometh into this 
world," as is written Jn. 1:9, is compared to the mind as the greater 
light to the lesser; since our mind is a light, being as it were a lamp 
enkindled by the First Light (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Prov++20:27">Prov. 20:27</a>): "The spirit of a man is the 
lamp of the Lord." Therefore in Christ Who is the Word of God, there is 
no need of a human mind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the assumption of human nature by the Word of God is 
called His Incarnation. But the intellect or human mind is nothing 
carnal, either in its substance or in its act. for it is not the act of a 
body, as is proved De Anima iii, 6. Hence it would seem that the Son of 
God did not assume a human mind.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine [*Fulgentius] says (De Fide ad Petrum xiv): 
"Firmly hold and nowise doubt that Christ the Son of God has true flesh 
and a rational soul of the same kind as ours, since of His flesh He says 
(<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++24:39">Lk. 24:39</a>): 'Handle, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as 
you see Me to have.' And He proves that He has a soul, saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Jn++10:17">Jn. 10:17</a>): 'I lay down My soul [Douay: 'life'] that I may take it again.' 
And He proves that He has an intellect, saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Mt++11:29">Mt. 11:29</a>): 'Learn of Me, 
because I am meek and humble of heart.' And God says of Him by the 
prophet (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Is++52:13">Is. 52:13</a>): 'Behold my servant shall understand.'"<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (De Haeres. 49,50), "the Apollinarists 
thought differently from the Catholic Church concerning the soul of 
Christ, saying with the Arians, that Christ took flesh alone, without a 
soul; and on being overcome on this point by the Gospel witness, they 
went on to say that the mind was wanting to Christ's soul, but that the 
Word supplied its place." But this position is refuted by the same 
arguments as the preceding. First, because it runs counter to the Gospel 
story, which relates how He marveled (as is plain from Mt. 8:10). Now 
marveling cannot be without reason, since it implies the collation of 
effect and cause, i.e. inasmuch as when we see an effect and are ignorant 
of its cause, we seek to know it, as is said Metaph. i, 2. Secondly, it 
is inconsistent with the purpose of the Incarnation,  which is the 
justification of man from sin. For the human soul is not capable of sin 
nor of justifying grace except through the mind. Hence it was especially 
necessary for the mind to be assumed. Hence Damascene says (De Fide Orth. 
iii, 6) that "the Word of God assumed a body and an intellectual and 
rational soul," and adds afterwards: "The whole was united to the whole, 
that He might bestow salvation on me wholly; for what was not assumed is 
not curable." Thirdly, it is against the truth of the Incarnation. For 
since the body is proportioned to the soul as matter to its proper form, 
it is not truly human flesh if it is not perfected by human, i.e. a 
rational soul. And hence if Christ had had a soul without a mind, He 
would not have had true human flesh, but irrational flesh, since our soul 
differs from an animal soul by the mind alone. Hence Augustine says (Qq. 
lxxxiii, qu. 80) that from this error it would have followed that the Son 
of God "took an animal with the form of a human body," which, again, is 
against the Divine truth, which cannot suffer any fictitious untruth.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Where a thing is by its presence, its image is not required 
to supply the place of the thing, as where the emperor is the soldiers do 
not pay homage to his image. Yet the image of a thing is required 
together with its presence, that it may be perfected by the presence of 
the thing, just as the image in the wax is perfected by the impression of 
the seal, and as the image of man is reflected in the mirror by his 
presence. Hence in order to perfect the human mind it was necessary that 
the Word should unite it to Himself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The greater light dims the lesser light of another luminous 
body; but it does not dim, rather it perfects the light of the body 
illuminated---at the presence of the sun the light of the stars is put 
out, but the light of the air is perfected. Now the intellect or mind of 
man is, as it were, a light lit up by the light of the Divine Word; and 
hence by the presence of the Word the mind of man is perfected rather 
than overshadowed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT TP Q[5] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the intellective power is not the act of a body, 
nevertheless the essence of the human soul, which is the form of the 
body, requires that it should be more noble, in order that it may have 
the power of understanding; and hence it is necessary that a better 
disposed body should correspond to it.<br>
